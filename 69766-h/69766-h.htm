<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> view of the growing interest in secondary
education in England, and the important educational
problems demanding solution, the Gilchrist
Trustees decided, in the early part of
1893, to send five women teachers to America
for the purpose of studying and reporting
upon Secondary Schools for Girls and Training
Colleges for Women in different parts of the
States. The Trustees made their intention
widely known, and invited the governing bodies
of the various women’s colleges and associations
of teachers to submit to them names of
persons specially qualified. Out of the list
of able and experienced women teachers thus
furnished to them, the Trustees, after careful
consideration of the qualifications of the
numerous candidates, selected the following
five: Miss Bramwell, B.Sc., Lecturer at the
Cambridge Training College; Miss Burstall,
B.A., Mistress at the North London Collegiate
School for Girls; Miss Hughes, Lecturer on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
Education at University College, Cardiff; Miss
Page, Head-Mistress of the Skinners’ Company’s
School for Girls, Stamford Hill, N.; and
Miss Zimmern, Mistress at the High School for
Girls, Tunbridge Wells. They were awarded
travelling scholarships of one hundred pounds
each to enable them to spend two months in
the United States in prosecuting their enquiries.
The five scholars visited America in the
summer of 1893, and submitted to the Trustees
carefully prepared Reports, two of which—viz.,
those by Miss Bramwell and Miss Hughes—are
presented to the public in this volume.
The Trustees have aided in the publication
of these Reports because they believe that a
knowledge of the educational systems and
experiments which have been tried in America
cannot fail to be of interest and value to those
engaged in teaching in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NOTE BY THE AUTHORS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> publishing the following reports, which we are
enabled to do through the courtesy and generosity
of the Gilchrist Trustees, it may not be altogether
out of place to submit a few prefatory remarks.
When the five Scholars were appointed to visit
American Schools and Colleges in the summer of
1893, it was found advisable, in view of the magnitude
of the task, to somewhat divide the responsibility.
Three of the number undertook to visit
and report upon institutions offering the means of
general education, while we desired to especially
investigate the provision made in the United States
for the Training of Teachers.</p>

<p>As our interests thus lay in one direction, the
Trustees further approved of our suggestion that we
should travel and work together, and this plan we
found most helpful and satisfactory. It will be seen
that we have covered exactly the same field, but we
have thought it desirable to write separate reports,
without mutual consultation, rather than to embody
the results of our work in a joint account.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GENERAL SKETCH OF THE AMERICAN
TOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR educational quest began in the city of New
York, on May 29th, 1893.</p>

<p>Having interviewed the City Superintendent, Mr.
J. Jasper, who gave valuable information as to what
was most worth seeing in connection with the
educational life of the city, we proceeded to the
Normal College of the city of New York. The
session was just closing, but we were able to see
some classes in physical training and cookery, and
to gain some insight into the methods employed in
other subjects. Two or three days were most
profitably spent at the Teachers’ Training College,
a sketch of the work of which is given elsewhere.
A hasty visit to Columbia College, with its annex
for women,—Barnard College,—a still more cursory
glance at the University of the city of New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
(our information concerning which we were fortunately
able to supplement at Chicago), with an
afternoon spent at the Press Fair, was all we were
able to accomplish at New York. The Press Fair
proved to be a most interesting exhibit of specimens
of the work in the public schools of New York.
The methods of teaching various subjects were set
forth, and we were especially struck, as again later
at the education exhibit of the World’s Fair, by
the apparatus and illustrations made by the children
themselves.</p>

<p>The power of “<i>making</i>,” whether of maps (drawn,
painted, modelled), models (in clay, putty, paper,
wood), pictorial illustrations of lessons (history,
geography, literature, natural science, and even
mathematics) appears to be much more encouraged
in America than in England. We made friends with
several of the school children at the Press Fair, who
proved most eager and interesting guides, naturally
anxious to fully explain what had been sent from
their own special schools.</p>

<p>Decoration Day (May 30th), on which New York
had a holiday, we determined to spend at Vassar
College. A pleasant railway journey up the banks
of the Hudson River brought us to the little town
of Poughkeepsie, two miles to the east of which is
Vassar College. Here we were most cordially
received, and spent the day in seeing over the
various buildings connected with it, and hearing
lectures. This college was founded in 1861 by
Mr. Matthew Vassar, who provided the grounds and
buildings, together with a sustentation fund of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
£50,000. He desired, to use his own words, “to
found and perpetuate an institution which should
accomplish for young women what our colleges are
accomplishing for young men.”</p>

<p>It led the way in opening the advantages of
a liberal education to women, and holds a place in
the first rank of women’s colleges in America. It
is undenominational, but, according to the wish of
its founder, daily prayers are held in the chapel,
and all classes meet on Sunday for the study of the
Scriptures. In order to emphasize the dignity of
manual labour, each student is expected to undertake
a small share in the household work of the
College, at least, at some period of her college
career. The ordinary course is for four years leading
to the degree of A.B. These four years are
known respectively as Freshman, Sophomore,
Junior, and Senior. A further course of two years
leads to the degree of A.M., and special courses
are also provided. There are, moreover, in connection
with the college, schools of music and painting,
the latter possessing a very fine collection of casts.
There is a uniform annual fee of £80 (400 dollars)
for board and tuition. The students’ rooms are
usually arranged in groups of three sleeping rooms
opening on to a common study. Just before our
visit the students had given a most successful performance
of the “Antigone.”</p>

<p>From New York we went to Philadelphia, where
the city superintendent, Dr. Edward Brooks, kindly
explained the city system of education. He is
keenly alive to the importance of the training of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
teachers, and ample provision for the same is made
in the city. For the training of men teachers, a
School of Pedagogy (the scheme for which was
drawn up by Dr. Brooks) has lately been opened in
connection with the Boys’ Central High School.
The Girls’ Normal School has had to serve the
double purpose of high school and place of training
for women teachers, but Dr. Brooks has long urged
the necessity of separating the two, and at this time
the new building for the Girls’ High School is being
erected. Kindergarten training is also not neglected,
and on our first evening in Philadelphia we
attended the commencement exercises of Mrs. van
Kirk’s Kindergarten Training School, at which the
graduates read essays on various educational topics,
sang songs and acted a little scene, in which the
virtues of the Kindergarten were set forth. The
next day we were able to visit the school itself, and
we found that, not content with providing the ordinary
graduating course, Mrs. van Kirk has
arranged for one that is post-graduate.</p>

<p>A delightful visit to the Drexel Institute, which
provides for the technical instruction of the city, a
glance at one of the largest Friends’ Schools, and an
unavailing attempt to see over the James Forten
Manual Training School, was all we had time for in
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Ten miles from Philadelphia, on the Pennsylvania
railroad, one reaches the Old Welsh settlement
of Bryn Mawr, with its college for women, which
bears the same name. Several halls and laboratory
buildings, standing in fifty acres of ground, make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
an imposing show. Of all the colleges that we
visited, Bryn Mawr appeared the most English,
and it needed the sight of a preserved specimen
of a wicked-looking snake, which had been killed
in the grounds, to convince us that we were really
on American soil.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact that the Professor of Mathematics,
Miss Scott, and three of the Fellows have
come there from Girton helped to build up the
illusion.</p>

<p>It is a college without rules; even attendance at
lectures is not compulsory, but as failure to pass at
the yearly examinations brings with it a request to
withdraw from the college, there is every inducement
to attend regularly. The same freedom is
extended to the choice of studies. Instead of the
four years’ course with the more or less definitely
prescribed work for each class which we found at
Vassar, Bryn Mawr has adopted the newer plan of
the group system, which allows more opportunity
for specialization. A distinctive feature of the
college is the attention paid to post-graduate work,
original research being especially encouraged. The
students have adopted caps and gowns, which, however,
are only worn within college precincts.</p>

<p>Acting on the suggestion of Dr. Brooks, we determined
to visit the two chief normal schools of the
state of Pennsylvania—West Chester and Millersville.
The little tree-shaded town of West Chester
was a pleasant change from the heat of Philadelphia.
It is a most distinctively Quaker settlement; even
the landlord of the little inn at which we stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
was a Friend, and wished to know if “thee was
travelling all by theeself.” The normal school is a
little way out, but easily reached by means of the
electric cars, which are to be found in even the
smallest American towns.</p>

<p>It was interesting to us as the first co-educational
normal school that we had seen. The dining and
lecture rooms are used in common, but the dormitory
accommodation is in two separate wings.</p>

<p>From West Chester we went to the normal school
at Millersville, near Lancaster. Returning north
through New York, we first stopped at New Haven,
Connecticut, a most picturesque place, famous as
being the location of Yale College.</p>

<p>Superintendent Curtis most kindly supplied us
with information about the State of Connecticut
and its normal schools. He also took us to see the
Welch Training School in New Haven, which, however,
is elsewhere described.</p>

<p>From New Haven we went to Hartford (visiting
the normal school of New Britain on the way),
and from thence to Willimantic, South Manchester,
and Springfield, Massachusetts. At Springfield the
Training School, and an interview with Superintendent
Balliet, gave ample material for thought. The
work carried on by Mr. Balliet in the city strikingly
exemplifies what a superintendent may do for the
cause of education. Not only does he give weekly
lectures on applied psychology and kindred subjects,
but he has paid special attention to the elaborating
of methods of teaching such subjects as arithmetic
and geometry, geography, English language, etc., on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
which he has published pamphlets, setting forth the
results of his thought and experience. It should be
noted that, as in America schools when inspected
are not judged by results, but by the methods
used, and the general teaching efficiency, it comes
about that the question of methods holds a more
important place in educational thought than in
England. More time, therefore, is devoted to their
study in normal and training schools, and a
superintendent has a wide field of influence in
the matter of methods in the city or district over
which he presides.</p>

<p>From Springfield the normal school at Westfield
was visited, and from thence we went on to Albany
to see the State Normal College and City Training
School.</p>

<p>Boston offered a wide choice in matters of educational
interest.</p>

<p>The Perkins Institute and Kindergarten for
the blind well repaid a visit. The former, associated
with the name of Laura Bridgman, has now in
Helen Keller and Annie Thomas two wonderful
examples of what education may do even for those
who lack what at first may seem the necessary basis
for all instruction—the senses of sight and hearing.
Helen Keller was not there at the time of our visit,
but we just saw her later at Chicago. When she
entered the Institute she, being blind, deaf, and consequently
speechless, lived in a state of almost
complete isolation, but now, through the careful
training of her marvellously acute sense of touch,
she can take a very full share in the life of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
world. She moves about quite fearlessly, recognising
people by a touch of the hand, speaking
easily (even sometimes in public), although, of
course, those speaking to her must use the hand-language,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
or let her put her fingers on their lips.
She is acquainted with a good deal of the best in
literature, and writes most poetically. Indeed, from
her letters it is difficult to suppose that she has
never seen or heard anything. Her life seems a
very happy one in spite of all, and she makes
friends everywhere. Annie Thomas was at the
Institute, however, at the time of our visit. She,
like Helen Keller, has only the sense of touch by
means of which to gain knowledge of the world, but
she too has learned to talk, write, sew, etc. She
acted as guide to us over the building, leading us
from room to room, and drawing our attention to
various things, including specimens of her own
work. Younger than Helen Keller, she is very fond
of dressing dolls, and felt our dresses all over, to try
to get new ideas in dressmaking. She appears to
have a good memory, and can recognise people after
a long lapse of time by just touching their hands.
We asked her through her teacher if she remembered
the visit of an Englishman, who some years
before had been there and had given her a little
ring; she remembered at once, and talked about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
him. In the Kindergarten we saw two other such
children—Willie Robin and Tommy Stringer. The
first, a little girl, is a pretty child, and seemingly
very intelligent. It was wonderful to see all the
little blind children playing Kindergarten games,
but when this child came forward and joined in
playing cat and mouse, with an evident keen sense
of the fun, and even sang the songs with the others,
finding out what was being sung by touching the
throat of the child next to her, we realized what
education had done for her. The little boy, Tommy
Stringer (who was admitted mainly through the
efforts of Helen Keller, who, having heard of him,
did not rest until she had secured his admission), is
only at the beginning of his training, and cannot
yet do much. Of course the first work of establishing
a system of communication with these children
is the most arduous, and patient indeed must be the
teachers who devote themselves to it.</p>

<p>Several times we crossed the river Charles to
Cambridge, for no visit to America would have been
complete without some time spent in seeing the leading
University of the country. It seemed curious
to find that women were still excluded from the
lectures, although in the Women’s Annex they are
allowed to work as if for a degree. It seemed strange
that such a state of things could exist in a land
which boasts itself of freedom and of the position
given to women. Indeed, it really appears that the
eastern States of America are behind England in
the matter of offering equal educational advantages
to men and women. There are, of course, the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Women’s Colleges of Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Vassar
and Smith, which offer splendid opportunities for
work, but their courses lead to degrees which are for
women only, and which will, for that reason alone,
never be considered as of such importance as those
which are also granted to men.</p>

<p>The Harvard Annex for Women has been opened
at Fay House, Cambridge. Professors and lecturers
from the University give their lectures over again at
the Annex for the benefit of the women students, who
can thus go through the course for a degree, which,
however, they may not receive, having to be content
with a certificate. We were able to be there on
Class Day, on which the students invite their friends
to an “at home” in honour of the women graduates.
At first all assembled in the library to listen to
appropriate speeches, then they dispersed into the
lecture rooms to talk to their friends, an arrangement
which gave the English visitors opportunity
to meet the various professors and lecturers. The
women’s Class Day, however, fades into insignificance
by the side of the men’s, which is the gala
day of Cambridge. The morning is devoted to
speeches by the students and professors, and in the
afternoon and evening the seniors (those who graduate)
have the opportunity of giving teas and
“spreads,” to which they invite their friends. On
the Tree of Liberty is hung the famous wreath, the
flowers of which are scrambled for at a given signal,
and dancing and other entertainments bring the day
to a close. Commencement Day, at which the actual
degrees are conferred, is held some days later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>From Boston we visited another famous college for
women—Wellesley, which takes rank and is conducted
on similar lines to those of Vassar and Bryn
Mawr. It is quite out in the country, and has
beautiful buildings and grounds of its own.</p>

<p>The Institute of Technology well repaid a visit.
It is a most imposing institution, every opportunity
being afforded in it for work of all kinds, chiefly,
it is true, for scientific work (the laboratories
and various departments being most splendidly
equipped with apparatus), but almost any subject can
be studied there. There are special courses arranged
for those who are actually engaged in teaching. We
also visited the Boston Normal and Rice Training
School, Normal Art School, and the Latin High
School. From Boston, we went to see the State
Normal Schools at Framingham, Bridgewater
Providence (Rhode Island), and the other Training
Schools at Fall River and Pawtucket.</p>

<p>The fame of the Quincy Schools, near Boston,
attracted us thither, and we spent a delightful morning
listening to lessons in the primary and grammar
grades of one of the best. It was of course a mixed
school, and every class had a large room to itself
with a continuous blackboard, all round the walls, of
which constant use was made either by teacher or
scholars. These blackboards are an essential part
of school-room furniture in America, and without
them a great deal of the teaching could not be carried
on. The teacher begins at one end of the
board facing the class, and can work right along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
side of the room, thus being able to leave all her
drawings, etc., unerased during the lesson. She can
also send any or all of the children to the blackboard
at once to work sums, write or draw. It was at
Quincy that Colonel Parker (now at Cook County
Normal School) began his work as school superintendent,
and through him the Quincy methods of teaching
attained an almost world-wide fame.</p>

<p>The little town of Milton, a few miles out of
Boston, among the Blue Mountains, was also a place
of interest. We there visited the Milton Academy,
an endowed school, chartered as far back as 1798,
and opened in 1807. It is a school for boys and
girls, although there is only a boarding-house for
boys. The Academy much resembles an English
High School, in that it provides education for children
between the ages of eight and eighteen, and
has an upper and lower school. It is really a preparatory
school for Harvard, the courses in the
upper school being determined by the requirements
for the Harvard entrance examination.</p>

<p>We asked the head-master as to the practical
working of co-education in a school of that kind.
He appeared to believe in it, and gave us an excellent
opportunity of learning how the boys and
girls themselves regarded it. The upper school had
to write for ten minutes on some given subject, and on
this morning the one announced was “co-education.”
We were afterwards allowed to look at the papers,
and were very much interested by them. About
half the pupils expressed no definite opinion at all—many
saying that as they had never been to a school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
on any other plan, they could not judge of the relative
merits of mixed or separate schools. The rest,
however, had fully made up their minds, some for
and some against. Those who defended the system
did so on the grounds of the higher standard of
work resulting from the rivalry between the boys
and girls, and of the good influence each had on the
other—the girls making the boys gentler, while the
boys’ admiration of courage tended to render the girls
braver. The objections brought against it were,
however, almost more interesting. Several boys objected,
because they said they had to work harder
than in schools for boys only, while some of the girls
who did not want to take the Harvard entrance
examination disliked the course of study rendered
necessary by it, and would have preferred to take
other subjects. According to one boy, “girls have so
much more time than boys (not playing so many
games), and therefore can easily get their lessons
perfect”; and another bewailed the fact that when
optional extra work was given out by the teacher,
“the girls always did it, and so got more marks.”
A more valid objection, perhaps, was that the school
had no reputation for athletics, or outdoor games, as
the girls took no interest in them. How far this
was really true in this particular case, we could not
judge; but wherever we went, we were struck with
the fact that American girls do not play or get
enough exercise in the open air. This dislike to outdoor
exercise and fondness for hot rooms (their
rooms are kept ten to fifteen degrees higher in temperature
than we consider healthy in England) are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
probably the chief causes of the delicacy and excitability
of American women.</p>

<p>One day was spent at Concord, so long the home
of Emerson, Hawthorne and Thoreau, where one realized
as never before what their lives and writings
have meant as educating influences in America.
The life of Concord seems to be in the past, and it
appears as if quietly awaiting the return of those
great presences which made it famous. The house
once occupied by the Alcotts is now in the possession
of Commissioner Harris, of Washington (Head of
the Bureau of Education), who spends a part of each
year there. The Concord schools are good, and a
new scheme, by which all children within a radius
of ten miles are collected in conveyances and brought
in to school, has just been adopted. This plan does
away with the necessity for district schools, which
are rarely efficient.</p>

<p>From Boston we started westward, and first
stopped at Syracuse. This is the seat of a Co-educational
University, placed on the top of the highest
hill, the view from which is very fine. Besides the
ordinary departments, it has one for music and one
for painting, which have both been carefully organized.
There is also an observatory.</p>

<p>By way of Oswego, Niagara and Detroit, we
reached Ann Arbor, the seat of the Michigan
State University, which is the centre of the
life of the town. It is co-educational and non-residential,
the students boarding with the people
of the place. It appeared that nearly every house
took in students, usually only to lodge, but other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
houses opened their doors at meal times, and it
was a curious sight to see students and others wending
their ways three times a day to certain houses
where they had arranged for meals.</p>

<p>The University has many departments, including
those of law, medicine and dentistry. Two graduates
of the last were Englishwomen, who are now
practising in Chicago.</p>

<p>We were fortunate enough to arrive there in
time for Commencement Day, when we saw several
hundred students receive degrees. They went up
on to the platform in batches of twenty or thirty
at a time, and were then handed their diplomas.
Neither the graduates nor the professors wore any
academic dress. Just below the platform, tables
were arranged which were covered with bunches
and baskets of flowers and presents. These were
placed there by the friends of the students, and
each bore the name of the one for whom it was
intended. At one point in the ceremony these were
handed round. An address is usually given by
some well-known speaker—this year by Dr. Charles
Warner.</p>

<p>This University is the crown of the Michigan
State system of education, and its advantages are
equally open to men and to women. All connected
with it seemed to approve of its being co-educational.
Great freedom is allowed to all
students, but he or she who will not work, and wastes
time and opportunities, has to leave. Graduation
time is also that chosen for the meeting together
of old students of the University. The students who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
graduate together are known as the “class” of the
year in which they take their degrees—such as the
“class of 1870,” or of “1890.” The members of the
various classes try to keep in touch with each other
all their lives, and like to meet at the University
at Commencement time. Several classes, in some
of which the members were all grey-headed, had
thus met together to talk over old times.</p>

<p>From Ann Arbor we went to see a Summer
School, at Benton Harbour, a watering-place on
Lake Michigan. The school was mostly attended
by teachers from the country, who wished to use
part of their holidays in preparing for one of the
Teachers’ State Examinations.</p>

<p>Here we spent the “glorious fourth,” being
roused by fireworks at three in the morning, and
obliged to tread the streets most carefully by day
to avoid stepping on the fire-crackers which lay
about everywhere.</p>

<p>Crossing the lake by steamer (a three or four
hours’ passage, in which we were quite out of sight
of land), we reached Chicago. There we stayed at
the new University, which, of course, was not then
in session. The dormitories were let out to those
who came for the Educational Congresses. Our
first sight of it was not inspiriting, for we arrived
at night, and the half-finished buildings, placed at
intervals on what must at no distant date have been
a swamp, looked cheerless and forlorn. Things
looked better in the morning sunshine; and we
then found that there was every promise of its being
a large and handsome University. It is co-educational,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
like Michigan, and has, moreover, three
women on the staff—one as Dean, one as Assistant-Professor
of English, and one as Lecturer in Spanish.
It is residential, some of the dormitories being built
for women and some for men.</p>

<p>The World’s Fair was held in the parks adjoining
the University. It would take too long to describe,
but one building must be mentioned—that of the
Liberal Arts, the top floor of which was entirely
given up to educational exhibits. Nearly every
country was represented, from Japan—which really
appears to be far advanced in the making of teaching
apparatus—to the exhibit of our own London
School Board, which was exceedingly well arranged,
and attracted much attention. The United States
had naturally the lion’s share of the space—each
State having a section allotted to it. In each section
places were given to the Universities, Normal Schools,
Public and Private Schools, and other Institutions.
Specimens of work, exercise books, apparatus, were
all shown. Several States had taken great pains
to make the exhibit complete. Some had collected
valuable statistics and placed them on revolving
screens, some had published pamphlets describing
certain branches of educational work in the State;
and some greatly heightened the value of the exhibits
by placing some one in charge who was
competent to explain them. Some exhibits were, of
course, much more valuable than others—the States
of Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York
appeared perhaps the most complete.</p>

<p>From these exhibits, and especially from those in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
charge of them, we learned much, and were able to
supplement the knowledge we had gained by visiting
the various schools.</p>

<p>Two Educational Congresses were held, the first
under the Women’s Branch of the World Congress
Auxiliary, began on July 17th, and the other, held
under the charge of the National Educational
Association, began on July 23rd.</p>

<p>Under each there were many sections, those for
the first being Higher Education, University Extension,
College and University Students, College
Fraternities, Kindergarten Manual and Art Education,
Social Settlements, Chautauquean Education,
Stenography, Teaching of the Deaf and of the
Blind.</p>

<p>For the second: Higher, Secondary, Elementary
and Kindergarten Education, School Supervision,
Training of Teachers’ Art, Vocal Music, Technological,
Industrial and Manual Business and Physical
Education, Rational Psychology and Experimental
Psychology in Education. On the whole the Congresses
were disappointing, with perhaps the exception
of that on Experimental Psychology; but
the people we met there were so interesting as to
quite make up for any loss in the Congresses themselves.</p>

<p>All our spare time we spent at the Cook County
Normal Summer School, Colonel Parker having
given us free passes to all lectures. There we met
teachers from all parts of the States and from
Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>We also visited the University Settlement in one
of the poorest parts of Chicago. It is known as
Hull House, and is conducted on much the same
lines as Toynbee Hall.</p>

<p>From Chicago we went to Chautauqua, the huge
encampment by the side of Lake Chautauqua, in
New York State. Here for several months in the
year people gather (no longer in log huts, but in
hotels and boarding-houses erected for the purpose)
to attend the summer school, or the religious meetings,
or simply to enjoy the social life and popular
lectures, concerts, etc., which make the time pass
quickly for them. Not only, however, in the
summer does Chautauqua exercise its influence. An
elaborate system of reading circles and education
by correspondence has been established, and connects
one summer meeting with another. It does educational
work among those who are reached in no
other way, and its influence is felt not only throughout
the States and America generally, but even in
Europe and far Japan.</p>

<p>We returned to New York through Ithaca, where
we stopped to see Cornell University. A University
Summer School was being held, and we
were able to attend some lectures, and interviewed
one or two professors.</p>

<p>A breakdown of the train by which we were to
leave Ithaca delayed our journey, so we arrived in
New York too late to see any more institutions,
and sailed from thence feeling sad at the thought
that such a delightful tour was ended; but glad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
too, at the remembrance of the many friends we had
made, and feeling that America would be no more
to us a land of strangers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">REPORT I<br>

<small><span class="smcap">By Amy Blanche Bramwell, B.Sc.</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN making my report of observations in one department
of the Educational System of the
United States, I am anxious to point out, at the
very outset, that the nature of that System (its
complexity, its many modifications, and the vast
extent it covers) renders the work of drawing
general conclusions from the data supplied by the
observations of one person a task of extreme difficulty.
The difficulty is further increased by the
fact that my personal observations were limited to
the North-Eastern States of Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, and Illinois. These States, although
covering only a small portion of the whole field
of observation, differ so greatly as regards conditions
and organization that they exhibit results widely
opposed, and furnish facts from which it is not easy
to generalize.</p>

<p>I had, however, many and valuable opportunities
of supplementing personal observations by a further
study of educational matters in the exhibit of the
Educational Department of the World’s Fair, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
by attending the Educational Congresses held in
Chicago in July, 1893. The meetings held during
the Educational Congress were, in themselves, disappointing.
Nevertheless they enabled me to meet
educationalists and teachers of all kinds from all
parts of the United States, and to learn, by personal
interviews, facts which it would have been impossible
to gain by merely visiting educational
institutions. I found throughout my visit that
personal interviews were an important means of
supplementing the observation of work actually
done in the schools. In some departments, the
most valuable information I gained was acquired
in this way, this being especially true in connection
with the Training of Secondary Teachers in the
Eastern States, where the subject, although widely
discussed, is only just beginning to have any practical
outcome.</p>

<p>In reporting on the Training of Teachers in the
United States, I have chiefly confined myself to the
work done in:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. State Normal Schools.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. City Normal and Training Schools.</p>

<p>iii. Departments of Pedagogy in Universities and Colleges.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that I make constant references to
methods of Science taught in the training schools,
and adopted in their connected model schools. This
is due to the fact that my observations were made
with especial regard to that branch of training. I
have not reported on the training of Kindergarten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
teachers, for although the question of Kindergarten
instruction is one of great interest and importance
at present in America, I had little opportunity of
seeing and judging the methods employed in the
preparation of teachers in that department.</p>

<p>I wish to record my grateful thanks to those who
so readily helped me in my work; and to express
my appreciation of the great kindness and hospitality
shown everywhere throughout my visit. I
should also like to take this opportunity of thanking
the Gilchrist Trustees, through whose liberality I
have been enabled to gain much that will be very
valuable to myself, and possibly something that may
be of interest or help to other teachers.</p>

<h3><i>STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS.</i></h3>

<p>The State Normal Schools are schools supported
wholly by a particular State, to provide trained
teachers for the public schools of that State. They
are under the management of State Boards of
Education, which determine the length of the
Normal School Course, and arrange the studies.
Much discretionary power is, however, given to the
principals or presidents of the respective schools.
Instruction is usually free to those who pledge themselves
to teach in the State, and, as a further inducement,
students attending non-resident schools
are allowed to come in by train at reduced fares, or
lodge and board in houses near the school at a very
low rate. Students of resident schools have rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and board in the school building, or in separate
smaller halls, or “dormitories,” at a rate of 150-180
dollars a year. To very needy students the State
makes extra grants. Most of the Normal Schools
are co-educational institutions; but a few admit
only women. In the co-educational schools, the
men and women have classes and meals in common,
and reside in different parts of one building, or in
adjacent buildings. It is a noticeable fact, however,
that in most of the co-educational Normal Schools
the women students outnumber the men. In the
two Pennsylvanian Schools I visited—those at
Westchester and Millersville—the discrepancy between
the numbers of men and women students was
not so great as in the Normal Schools of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and New York, which devote
themselves more strictly to professional training,
<i>i.e.</i> to pedagogical instruction and teaching practice.
Having enquired as to the cause of the greater
number of women students, I was told it was due
to the fact that teaching, as a profession, offers few
attractions to men in the United States, and that
in those few Normal Schools where the attendance
of men and women students is almost equal the
courses are such as to allow of their being used by
the men as preparatory courses for college. Such
an explanation seems to be corroborated by the
relative numbers of men and women teachers in
many of the States. In Massachusetts, the number
of teachers is 10,965, and of these only 992 are men.
In Illinois, there are 23,033 teachers in the Common
Schools, and among them only 7,091 men. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
New York, of the 32,161 teachers in the State
schools, 26,869 are women.</p>

<p>The first Normal Schools were established in
Massachusetts in 1839. The particular needs which
these early schools were intended to satisfy, and
their early aims, have influenced the courses of instruction
and lines of work of most of the Normal
Schools since established, whether in Massachusetts,
or in other States. The purpose of the early schools
at Lexington and Barre was to provide more competent
teachers for the lower grades of schools, and
their course of training embraced:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. The subjects of an ordinary school curriculum, known
as “academic studies,” as distinguished from
pedagogical or “professional studies.”</p>

<p>&#160;ii. Instruction in the Art of Teaching and Governing.</p>

<p>iii. Practice in Teaching in the Common Schools.</p>
</div>

<p>The standard of admission to these early Normal
Schools was low, and at that time, opportunities for
any thorough study outside universities were few,
especially in the case of women. Accordingly their
theory of training gave the greatest importance to
“a careful review of the branches of knowledge
required to be taught in schools.” The first business
of a Normal School was said, by Horace Mann, to
consist “in reviewing, and thoroughly and critically
mastering the rudiments of elementary branches
of knowledge.” And although conditions have
changed much since 1839, most of the Normal
Schools of the United States still pursue the lines
of work adopted by Massachusetts. Standards of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
admission have been raised, courses of study have
been correspondingly extended, but the Normal
Schools, with a few exceptions, still remain more
or less efficient schools for the teaching of ordinary
subjects, and devote half the course, and in many
cases even more, to academic work. It is thus a
distinctive feature of Normal School work to pursue
school subjects side by side with professional, or
pedagogical subjects. But there seems a general
tendency to emphasize the academic part, at the
expense of the professional. Examples of the courses
of study for Massachusetts and New York, two of
the foremost of the Eastern States in educational
matters, will indicate this.</p>

Advanced Algebra and Geometry, Trigonometry, Surveying.<br>

Advanced Chemistry, Physics and Botany.<br>

Drawing, English Literature, General History.<br>

Latin, French, German or Greek.<br>
</div>

<p>The order of studies, and the relative lengths of
time spent on academic and professional studies, is
determined by the president of the school. In the
Bridgewater School, pedagogical subjects are not
studied systematically until the fourth term or
semester, for those who take the Two Years’ Course,
and the seventh semester, for those who take the
Four Years’ Course. Thus with the exception of
a single semester, and a few hours of the first
semester given to an introduction of psychology, the
whole of the two years or four years is devoted to
school subjects. In the Westfield School, the last
half-year of the Two Years’ Course is devoted to
pedagogical subjects, and the additional work of the
Four Years’ Course is entirely academic.</p>

<p>The studies prescribed for the Normal Schools of
New York State are in three courses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. The English Course, comprising the usual English
subjects, Mathematics and Science. This occupies
three years.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. The Classical Course, comprising more advanced English
subjects, Mathematics and Science, with Latin and
Greek, or German and French. This occupies four
years.</p>

<p>iii. The Scientific Course, including all subjects of the
English Course, with two years’ study of two of
the languages, Latin and Greek, French, German.</p>
</div>

<p>The order of subjects, and relative times devoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to academic and professional studies, is approximately
the same for all the Normal Schools of New
York State. Taking the schools of Oswego and
Oneonta as examples, we find:—</p>

<p><i>Three Years’ Course</i>: Psychology, philosophy,
history of education and methods of teaching various
subjects, taken up for the first half of the third year,
and sometimes made to extend into the second half
of the same year.</p>

<p><i>Four Years’ Course</i>: The same work, chiefly done
in the first half of the fourth year.</p>

<p>It is maintained by some, that all the Normal
School work is professional, in that throughout the
curriculum the aim is to present the subject matter
of instruction in the way that the teacher should
present it to his or her class of children, and so to
make the lessons model lessons. I was present at
some excellent lessons of this kind: a geography
lesson and a history lesson in the Bridgewater
Normal School. But for the most part the needs
of the Normal School pupils themselves, and not
the needs of imaginary future school children, have
to be considered, and the Normal School lessons
or “recitations” resolve themselves into ordinary
school lessons. Even if we assume, however, that
this is not the case, and that great skill is shown
on the part of the Normal School teacher, may not
such a plan of teaching “Methods” be dangerous,
in that it encourages imitation and rigidity. Such
appears to me to be the tendency of the generally
adopted plan, of giving professional training in
“Methods,” by actual lessons in the various subjects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
given by the Normal School teacher; and the
danger of encouraging cut and dried methods is
intensified where it is the custom for a Normal
School student to give a lesson to children, or her
fellow-students in that subject and section of a
subject which has just been presented to her by
the Normal School teacher. It is maintained by
others that apart from any advantage which may
accrue to the students from hearing good lessons in
the various subjects they will have to teach, it is
absolutely necessary that each student should change
her standpoint, and review the various branches of
knowledge as a teacher, rather than as a pupil.
This, it is argued, is secured by such a plan of
teaching “Methods.” As a third motive, it is held
that direct teaching of ordinary school subjects is
necessary before beginning pedagogical instruction,
on account of the inadequate and unequal preparation
which the future teachers bring to their work.
It seems to me that both these necessities might be
obviated by more rigid requirements for admission
to Normal Schools. The well-equipped High Schools
can do the academic work of the Normal Schools
with less effort than can the Normal Schools themselves;
and were the standards of admission such as
to necessitate a thoroughly sound preliminary knowledge
in common school subjects, might not the
Normal School students be found more capable of
themselves reviewing old facts from a new standpoint,
and the schools have more time and opportunity
to carry out other means of training?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Academic Studies.</span></h4>

<p>It is a marked feature in the academic work of
Normal Schools that great importance is given to
the teaching of science. Here, as in American
Schools in general, a large place in the curriculum
is given to what is known as “nature study.” Extensive
laboratories, for the different branches of
science, are fitted up in most of the schools; books,
microscopes, physical, chemical and biological apparatus,
specimens for observation and dissection,
are supplied free to students; outdoor work is
organized, weather-charts are kept daily, and
students are encouraged to use the school workshops
for making simple physical apparatus for their own
use. In all the schools great stress is laid upon
practical work by each individual student. The
following list shows the number of lesson-hours
given to science at the Normal School, Bridgewater,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>The school, which numbers 274 pupils, has five
laboratories—viz., chemical, physical, physiological
and zoological, geological and industrial, and the
equipment of these, and the care with which students
kept daily records of laboratory work, were its
special features. The chemical laboratory is in two
sections: one for elementary, and one for advanced
students, and between these is a teachers’ laboratory.
The students’ daily records of work are carefully
examined by the teacher, and much use is made, by
both teachers and students, of the continuous wall slate
round the class-rooms and laboratories. Physiology
is taught by aid of the skeleton and life-size
models, also by the dissection of lower animals, and
microscopical examination of tissues. The methods
and means adopted for geology and geography
teaching at Bridgewater seemed to be particularly
good. In the school museum were duplicate collections
of rocks and minerals, classified on various
bases; and in addition to these, the school possessed
two sets of trays of working specimens, one set
containing labelled typical class specimens, and the
other containing unlabelled specimens for identification
by students. Books, giving printed directions
for work, interleaved with blank sheets for observations,
notes and drawings, were provided for all
students. I heard two excellent lessons in geography
at this school. One on the Slopes of the
United States was well worked out with the
students in sand, great care being taken by the
teacher to state and compare actual distances, so
that the relief-map should not convey an impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
of false proportion. The other was a lesson in map-drawing
from memory. All students had places at
the slate round the room, and two minutes were
given to draw the outline of a map previously
prepared. Then one minute was given for the
drawing of a particularly difficult isolated part of
the outline. When this was done, a correct map
was uncovered, and students were required to
correct their own drawings. After the drawings
had been individually criticised by the teacher,
faults were generalized, and help was given.</p>

<p>The special features of the science work at the
Normal School, Willimantic, Connecticut, is the
emphasis placed on manual training, and its practical
connection with all science teaching. All
students, men and women, are required to invent,
or make with their own hands, simple apparatus
for teaching the elementary facts of physics. I
saw students in the workshops, making relief-maps
and models for their lessons. One was constructing
a very simple model of a water-wheel, to illustrate
lessons on the conservation of energy; another was
making a relief-map of paper pulp, on a ground of
blue-painted wood.</p>

<p>In this school the students do not, as a rule,
follow stated text-books in science. Wide reading
is encouraged, and there is an excellent library of
standard text-books and works of reference. There
is also a model library of children’s literature for the
students’ use, and an exhibition of the latest devices
for “busy-work.” “Busy-work” is the work done
alone by one section of a class, while the other is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
being directly taught by the teacher. All sorts of
occupations are devised by the clever teacher for
impressing facts already learnt, and the “busy-work”
hour is frequently employed in cutting out
outline maps, sorting beads, counting beans, etc.
The object of the exhibition of “busy-work” at
Willimantic is to encourage examination and criticism
of such devices with regard to their educational
value. The figures representing the amount
granted to this Normal School last year, for “busy-work”
exhibits, library books, text-books, periodicals,
etc., were kindly given to me by the Principal, and
I note them here, as an illustration of the readiness
of New England States to furnish school supplies
and apparatus. A few details of expenditure for
the past year, which was by no means an exceptional
year, are:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Text-books and School Supplies for Normal<br>&#160; &#160;and Model School </td><td class="mid"><img src="images/bracket2right.png" alt=""></td><td> 1,500 dollars.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Thus more than £450 was spent in one year for
library materials, in a school numbering less than
150. The abundant supply of apparatus and books
for the teaching of science, and the importance
given to practical work, are a marked feature in all
the schools. At the Albany Normal School for
teachers in higher grades and colleges, the students
spend most of their free afternoons in making physical
apparatus for their own future use. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
laboratory here is well equipped, and the work is
done with great care, accuracy and finish. I saw
a home-made tangent galvanometer, and a Wheatstone’s
bridge in constant use for somewhat fine
measurements.</p>

<p>At the Normal School, Worcester, Massachusetts,
plant study receives special attention. This is not
technical botany as usually understood, but is
rather a daily observation and record of plant surroundings,
the practical study of all stages of
plant-life. A feature of the study is the daily
exhibit, made by the pupils in turn, of some plant
in bud, leaf, flower or fruit, with its common and
scientific name, and the place where it was gathered.
Directories furnishing information respecting the
localities of trees and plants in the neighbourhood
are made in the school, and dates of their times of
blossoming are noted from year to year on special
blank sheets provided for the purpose. Moreover,
collections of the woods of different trees, and of
leaves of trees growing within the county are made.
Work of this kind is usually done in the free hours
for independent study, which each student has
several times during the day. Practical gardening
is also systematically done in free time.</p>

<p>The lessons in science, unless actual laboratory
lessons, are usually given in the form of “recitations.”
A “recitation” is a lesson in which certain parts
of a subject, specially prepared beforehand, are contributed
by the pupils. The teacher asks questions
and explains difficulties, and generally connects the
facts brought forward; but the material of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
lesson is wholly supplied by the pupils. This
way of working out a subject has at least two
distinct advantages over our own method of lesson-giving,
in which the chief work devolves upon the
teacher. By the recitation method the pupils are
taught how to use books, how to gather from many
sources material for their recitation. They also
learn to rely on their own efforts in class-time, and
to be alert in thought and speech. The disadvantages
of the plan, however, seem even more apparent.
Where one text-book is chiefly used in a subject, or
even where several books are referred to, there is a
distinct tendency to “recite” in the words of the
book. Several times I heard lessons in which such
“recitations” were accepted by the teacher. This
method, moreover, seems likely to lead to too great
a dependence on text-books, and too constant a
reference to books, on points where thought and
reflection might be better guides. It also encourages
digression in class, and a resulting slowness in getting
through the subject matter, unless the teacher
be very skilful in conducting the “recitation.” The
constant raising of points by the students, at all
parts of the discussion, leads sometimes to waste of
time by debating on questions of merely individual
opinion. Such results point to the difficulty of
conducting an ordinary recitation. Great skill and
much experience are needed, before such a lesson
can be made completely satisfactory, and many are
the teachers’ temptations to omit careful preparation.
As a method to be used constantly, and in all subjects,
it seems open to many objections, and to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
but few advantages. As resorted to occasionally,
and by skilful teachers, and as particularly adapted
to subjects such as geography or history, the
“recitation” may be made a valuable means of
training.</p>

<p>The tendency to bookishness and slavery to word-forms,
which may seem to be encouraged by the
recitation method of teaching science in the Normal
Schools, is opposed by a greater tendency to emphasize
the concrete, to refer in all science teaching
directly to the objects themselves, to use laboratory
methods wherever possible. Observation and experiment
are essentially the methods of many of the
American science teachers, and no pains are spared
to illustrate all facts and principles by an appeal to
the senses. As a result, much of the science teaching
is excellent. On the other hand, there seems a
possible danger of pursuing these excellent methods
too far, of appealing to the senses alone, at stages
of development in the child when reason and reflection
might be appealed to and trusted, and of
generally emphasizing the value of observation at
the expense of neglecting the reflective faculties.
In the excellent <i>Outlines of Laboratory Work</i>, used
by some of the Normal Schools, the danger is to
some degree recognised by <i>Questions for Thought and
Reference</i> being placed at the end of each lesson-scheme.
Assuming, however, that the questions are
followed out carefully by the students, it may still
be doubted whether this is the best method of
arousing thought.</p>

<p>Another feature of the science teaching in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Normal Schools is the taking up of many branches
of science. Chemistry, physics, astronomy, geology,
mineralogy, zoology, botany, physiology, are studied
by all. In order that students may be able to take
up all these, the plan usually adopted is to concentrate
attention on one science for a short time, and
then to pass on to other sciences, until five or six
have been taken. It is seldom that even one
branch of science is allowed to run through a whole
course of two years. The division of science studies
for the Normal School at New Britain, Connecticut,
where the science work is most carefully done, will
illustrate this point.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that no preliminary
science is required for admission to the Normal
Schools, and that many of the entering students
have not done any work in the subject at all, it
seems impossible that any very thorough knowledge
can be secured in a course of five, ten, or even
thirteen weeks. It may be possible for the
student to obtain and verify a few scientific facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
during a short course such as this; but there is no
time or opportunity to realize the extent or bearing
of the subject in hand, or to study it adequately in
a scientific way. To allow a beginner to feel he
has completed a course in geology, botany, or any
other science in thirteen weeks is to encourage
superficiality, to arouse in him a feeling of satisfaction
and attainment, and surely nothing can be
more opposed to the true spirit of science. In the
New Britain School, physics is carried through fifty-three
of the eighty weeks in the Two Years’ Course;
and this seems a good plan, even if, during some
part of the time, only two or three hours a week
can be given to it. When one science, or possibly
two, are chiefly taken up, and others considered
merely accessory to the main subject of study,
a more adequate knowledge of science and scientific
method can be gained, especially if the sciences
taken up are such as botany, and physics, which
illustrate respectively different methods of scientific
research.</p>

<p>It may be maintained that the Normal School
students must be prepared for their future work in
the Primary and Grammar Schools, in most of
which the elements of several sciences are taught.
This, of course, must be remembered. Nevertheless,
the attitude of mind developed by the thorough
study of one science is the best possible preparation
for the safe study of the elements of others, while
a superficial study of the elements of many sciences
is fatal to the proper estimation of facts in any one
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Professional Work.</span></h4>

<p>The purely professional work of the Normal State
Schools consists of:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Instruction in the theory of education and its application.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Actual practice in teaching, under the guidance of experienced
teachers.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Theory of education.</p>
</div>

<p>It is usual for the Normal Schools of the Eastern
States to postpone the study of strictly pedagogical
subjects until half or more of the course has been
completed. School methods are sometimes taught
in connection with academic subjects in the early
part of the course; but such instruction, coming, as
it does, before any principles of the science of education
have been considered, or any practical experience
has been gained, must be purely empirical.
At the Normal School, Millersville, Pennsylvania,
school management is taken during the first year,
and applied psychology (as distinguished from empirical
methods), history of education, and school
teaching, are required during the second year. If
the student takes up a further scientific or post-graduate
course, additional professional studies are
required—viz., psychology and the philosophy of
education, ethics, logic, and professional reading. In
the Westchester Normal School, Pennsylvania, no
professional work is taken up until the second year.
Then psychology is studied, and history of education;
and methods and school practice are taken. The additional
pedagogical studies for the advanced courses
are the same as at Millersville. At the Normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
School, Bridgewater, Massachusetts, the students,
after having studied the elements of psychology,
during their first semester, leave all technical studies
until the fourth semester, when they take up simultaneously,
study of the body, study of the mind,
principles of education and methods, school organization,
school government, history of school laws of
Massachusetts. A fifth semester, when it can be
given, is devoted entirely to professional work and
actual teaching. At the Normal School, New
Britain, Connecticut, psychology is given four times
a week during most of the two years’ course. Text-books
are not used except for reference. No pure
psychology is studied, but school subjects are taken
up one by one, and their facts and methods of treatment
are used to illustrate psychological principles.
The history of education is studied side by side with
this applied psychology; but not much time is given
to this subject in class. The lives and works of the
chief educators only are taken, and private reading
is much encouraged as accessory to the class work.
At the Normal School, Willimantic, Connecticut,
psychology is studied one hour a day throughout
the last year, and is treated almost entirely from
the physiological standpoint. No special text-book
is used, but Spencer and Darwin are recommended
for reference. The history of education is not taken
up systematically in class, but the work and influence
of modern educators, such as Arnold, Thring,
and Horace Mann, are thoroughly discussed. At
the Normal School, Worcester, Massachusetts, class
work in psychology is taken almost daily throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the whole course. The value attributed to the
subject, and the unique way in which it is studied,
together with other points distinctive of the professional
work, give to the Worcester School a foremost
place among New England Normal Schools.
The method adopted for its study is one which
entirely leaves the beaten track of ordinary text-books.
It does not, in the earlier stages, trouble the
student with the divisions and generalities of pure
psychology, but rather fixes his attention solely on
the child, and seeks to gain from actual observation
and individual and combined experience laws which
shall be valuable aids in teaching. “The principal
requests the students to observe the conduct of children
in all circumstances—at home, at school, in
the street, at work, at play, in conversation with one
another and with adults, and record what they see
and hear as soon as circumstances will permit.”
The work thus suggested has been organized as a
definite part of the school course, and although
optional, is usually taken up by all students. It is
intended, not to supplant, but to supplement later
systematic instruction in psychology, and is taken
up, not for the sake of the facts gained, which may
or may not be of intrinsic worth, but for the value
of the process of such observation to the teacher.
In order to help forward the systematic study of
children, a scheme of work is drawn up. Records
are to be made whenever convenient, and for these
records blank sheets of six different colours are provided.
The colours are a means of roughly classifying
the records into six groups, thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(i.) Facts of personal observation.</p>

<p>(ii.) Facts related by others, together with names of recorder
and observer.</p>

<p>(iii.) Personal reminiscences of childhood.</p>

<p>(iv.) Facts gained from books.</p>

<p>(v.) Observations on exceptional or defective children.</p>

<p>(vi.) Continuous observations.</p>
</div>

<p>Each record must contain the date of the observation,
the observer’s name, age, and post-office
address, as well as the name or initials of the child
observed, its age, sex, nationality. There must be
also a statement of the length of time which has
elapsed between the observation and the record.
These records are preserved and catalogued under
such heads as knowledge, imagination, feeling.
Special attention is being directed to the subject of
child language, and pupils and old students are
supplied with small indexed books for records in
this particular department. Further opportunities
for daily observation and experiment in certain
lines of child-study and in teaching are offered in
a newly organized children’s class or kindergarten.
The students merely watch the class, the teaching
being entirely in the hands of two experienced
kindergartners. As the class exists for the acknowledged
purpose of experiment, tuition is free, and
the teachers in charge have full liberty to follow
any course they wish. When I saw the school, a
long series of daily experiments were being made,
with a view to finding out whether, when left perfectly
free, the boys secured places next to girls by
preference.</p>

<p>Much time is given to “Methods” in all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Normal Schools. Besides the so-called “Methods”
taught by means of academic studies, the subject
is usually taken up again in connection with applied
psychology. The school subjects, treated one by one
in detail, are used to illustrate principles of education,
while much reference is made at every stage
to the personal experience of teacher and students.
Many different plans are adopted in teaching
“Methods.” At the Normal School, Westchester,
I heard a lesson which was in the form of a modified
“recitation.” A certain point had been chosen for
discussion. The students had prepared the subject
beforehand, and some had written short essays,
which they read in turn. Afterwards the whole
class was questioned by the teacher. As new ideas
were brought forward, they were noted on the
blackboard by the students who supplied them,
until a complete sketch was made. A discussion
on “Noise in Class” was carried on somewhat in
the same way. At Westfield, Massachusetts, the
lessons on “Didactics” are carried out on a similar
plan, the students being called upon in turn to
furnish certain parts of the subject, and to build up
a sketch on the blackboard.</p>

<p>At the Normal School, Albany, methods are
taught thus:—With each of three terms of psychology,
certain subjects are chosen for consideration.
A syllabus of work in a certain subject is given
in by each student. It is carefully discussed in
class. Then parts of the detailed syllabus are taken
in order, methods of dealing with any particular
part discussed, and one method decided upon as best.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
For the next day, all the students prepare a lesson
on the part selected, and any one of them may be
called upon to give it to his or her fellow-students.
Then follows criticism by teacher and students.
The plan of requiring all students to consider detailed
methods in all subjects seems not to be
altogether a good one. It assumes a knowledge of
all the subjects of study on the part of all students,
a condition only attainable at the price of superficiality.
Even where a general knowledge of subjects
can be relied upon, details in method cannot
do other than encourage empiricism, in cases where
the knowledge of the subject matter is not thorough
and complete. It would seem better, especially in
the case of training institutions like that at Albany,
designed to give purely professional training to
teachers of higher grades, to encourage more
specialization, and to allow all students some choice
of method subjects, so that dead forms of method
might be made as few as possible. The system of
giving detailed methods to all stimulates, too, a
tendency to rigid forms of lesson-giving, and somewhat
encourages the idea that there is only one
good arrangement of subject matter for a particular
lesson, and one good way of giving it. This is, I
think, a danger of all method-teaching; but it is
much intensified where methods are discussed in
great detail.</p>

<p>The actual methods taught in the Normal Schools,
and followed out in the connected Model Schools,
vary so much as regards both principles and details,
that it is almost impossible to report on them as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
whole. It is a feature of many of the Normal
Schools to cling to old methods, and lines of
work of twenty, thirty or forty years ago; while, on
the other hand, a few of the Normal Schools I saw—those
of Connecticut, the Oswego Normal School,
and Colonel Parker’s School, at Englewood, Chicago—seem
to be leaders in a campaign which is beginning
to revolutionize “Methods” in America.</p>

<p>The educational principle which is effecting this
reform is the connection or correlation of studies, a
theory the most fully expressed and applied at the
Cook County Normal School, Illinois. As a result
of this theory, the hard and fast lines between the
so-called subjects of study are being broken down.
Reading is taught in all the grades through nature
study, history and literature; <i>e.g.</i>, natural objects
studied by the children in different grades, or poems
in the selected literature for the year, serve as
subjects for reading lessons. The children are encouraged
to express their ideas orally on these
subjects, and the teacher writes their statements
on the blackboard, and takes care that the statement
is really the expression of an idea in the child’s
mind. When various sentences, given by the children,
have been connected and arranged, the class
reads from the board, and afterwards from printed
or type-written copies of what has been written.
Thus the children make their own reading books,
and need no ordinary reading primers. This
method, as adapted to the earliest stages of reading,
necessarily implies the learning of script before
printed characters, also the learning of words and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
sentences as wholes, and their necessary association
with the thought which they express. So, too,
writing and drawing, as modes of expressing
thought, are taught in close connection with all
other subjects. At New Britain, the teacher of drawing
in the Model School is present at all literature
lessons, and children are encouraged to illustrate
their literature by drawings or paintings. In papers
on the “Spontaneous Drawings of Children,”
read at the Chicago Educational Conference by
Professor Earl Barnes, of Leland Stanford University,
California, he showed how much of this
illustrative work of children was being used by
himself and others in the cause of experimental
psychology.</p>

<p>At the Model School connected with the Oswego
Normal School, natural history is made the central
subject, and reading, writing, and drawing are made
to bear upon it. The natural history course, including
both plants and animals, is most carefully
planned to suit the seasons of the year. As each
plant or animal is studied, it is drawn by the
children, stories are told about it, the children write
about it, read about it, and make it a general object
of study for some time. The work is carefully
graded for different ages, but the subject or topic
of study is the same throughout the school at the
same time.</p>

<p>At the Cook County Normal School, Illinois, all
the teaching is made to group itself round three
subjects—science, geography, history; and these
subjects are made to include everything forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the environment of the child. The study of form
and number, instead of being followed as separate
subjects in themselves, are considered merely as
means of studying these three comprehensive subjects—as
modes of thinking in fact. Hearing, observing,
and reading are regarded as different ways
of gaining ideas, and as such, silent reading is
encouraged, and many devices are used for helping
the child to get quickly and clearly the ideas from
the printed or written page. Writing, music,
modelling, painting, drawing, speaking, are considered
as means of expressing ideas about objects
studied—the act of expression making the ideas
clearer. Thus, number or arithmetic is taught, not,
as is usual, by means of problems specially made
and arranged in books of arithmetical examples;
but in close connection with any class subject. I
heard part of a course of excellent laboratory lessons
in Science, given to Summer School Students at
this school, and as the methods employed were those
of the ordinary Normal School Course, I may
mention them here. At the end of each lesson
the teacher used the numerical results obtained by
individual students, and worked them into arithmetical
problems. For example, the subjects used
for successive number lessons were as follows:</p>

<p>Conductivity of heat in metals.</p>

<p>Expansion of metals by heat.</p>

<p>Determination of boiling-point of fresh and salt
water.</p>

<p>Such a treatment of subjects is a strong protest
against routine work and rigid method. It allows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
great scope to the teacher by concentrating attention
on the child and its needs, rather than on the
artificial divisions into so-called subjects, and their
methods. On the other hand, it puts great responsibility
upon the teacher, and taxes his skill to the
utmost. There are many difficulties in adopting
the plan, one of the chief being the construction of
the school time-table. In any case, the practical
application of such a system can only be partial,
until all teachers are enthusiasts and experts; but
the lines of work seem to be true lines, and may be
suggestive of much that shall reform some of our
own old methods.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Practice in Teaching.</span></h4>

<p>It is usual for each Normal School to have attached
to it a Model School, which serves the double
purpose of model and practising school for students.
The head of the Model School and her assistants
are experienced teachers, known as the critic
teachers, and to the care and supervision of these
the students are submitted during their training in
practical teaching. All the Normal Schools I saw
had such a Model School except the one at Providence,
Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The amount of time actually devoted to teaching
by each student is different in different States, and
the plans by which the required amount is secured
for all vary in the different schools.</p>

<p>The State of Pennsylvania requires of its Normal
School students actual practice in teaching for one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
hour a day during three-fourths of the last year of
the Course; but students generally do more than
this. At Westchester, Pennsylvania, the students
go into the Model School in sections of six each
morning after 10.30. A new section is chiefly engaged
in observing the children, and hearing lessons
given by the critic teachers or other students.
Later, the students teach, but always under supervision.
The subject matter of their lessons is
definitely mapped out for them by the critic
teacher, and they discuss with her the best ways
of treating it. There are no written notes of lessons,
and no public criticism of lessons, either by teachers
or students. Each week, meetings of teachers and
students are held, for the purpose of taking up any
points noted during the students’ work of the week.
These are really talks supplementary to the ordinary
method lectures. At Millersville, Pennsylvania, each
student gives two or three lessons every day for a
year. She teaches in different grades, and takes
lessons in different subjects, and has also practice
in managing simultaneously several divisions of one
class.</p>

<p>At the Oswego Normal School, under the regulations
of the New York State, the student is in the
schools only twenty weeks, but during this time she
has much responsibility. She spends ten weeks in
a primary or elementary grade, and ten weeks in a
more advanced grade, and during the whole time is
practically responsible for her class. Each afternoon,
after the school is dismissed, the teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
class remains for an hour to discuss any points of
difficulty with the Head of the Model School.</p>

<p>At Willimantic, Connecticut, the teaching class
spends its first four weeks in general observation of
children, and hearing lessons. Then each student
is placed under the supervision of one special critic
teacher, and she continues some of the courses of
work already begun by the critic teacher. At least
four weeks are spent by each student in every grade
in the school, first in observing, then in teaching
under the criticism of the class teacher.</p>

<p>The Model School at New Britain, Connecticut, is
preserved strictly as a Model School. After observing
teacher and class for some time, the student
usually gives one trial lesson in the school, but there
is no systematic teaching by the student. For the
actual independent practice, the student must go to
a practising school outside New Britain, and be
entirely responsible for a class for four months. At
the large practising school in connection with the
New Britain Normal School, at South Manchester, I
saw students dealing with the actual difficulties of
discipline and class-management. Each student
was in charge of a large class with different divisions
or grades. There were four responsible,
experienced teachers for reference in cases of emergency,
and for criticism; but each student had
her own class, and the school of 700 children
was practically managed by students. Such is
the general plan of practice-work in the Normal
Schools.</p>

<p>Much care is given to the Model Schools. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
class-rooms are supplied with all necessary apparatus,
and they are bright and airy, and well supplied
with flowers and children’s books. It is quite
customary in some of the schools to give short
periods in school hours for private reading, or to
allow one child to read to the other children while
they are doing some kind of mechanical work.
Much importance is laid upon the observation of the
teaching in Model Schools. It is possible, however,
that this is insisted on too early in the course; indeed,
the hearing of lessons is usually the students’
first work in the school. It would be much more
profitable, and there would be less danger of blind
imitation, if the student had herself previously
gained experience in teaching. As it is, the danger
of imitation, and one-sided and narrow lines of
teaching is increased by the fact that one student is
chiefly under the supervision of one teacher.</p>

<p>At the Worcester Normal School there is no Model
or practising School, but the students teach in the
public schools of the city. For the first six months
of her last year at the Normal School, the student
acts as an apprentice or pupil-teacher, serving in at
least three grades during this time. Each teacher
has the direction of only one student, who may be
left in sole charge of the class for hours or days.
One day in the week the apprentice-student attends
the Normal School, where she shows her class diary
for the week, and discusses any difficulties that may
have arisen. On that day, too, she takes part in the
“Platform Exercises” of the Normal School—viz.,
exercises in which students speak, read or draw, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the platform, in presence of the whole school. The
apprentice-students usually give an account to their
fellow-students of anything interesting or helpful
in their practical work of the past week.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Examinations.</span></h4>

<p>At the end of the Normal School Course, State
examinations are held in most of the States. In
Pennsylvania each school examines its own students,
who, when they have satisfactorily completed the
required course of study, and passed the final examination,
receive a certificate, and are said “to
graduate.” After graduation, they are recommended
to the State Examiner, who awards a State-Teaching
Certificate valid for two years. At the end of this
period, the teacher is required to present to the State
Board a certificate of good work from the county
Superintendent under whom he or she has taught,
and also a certificate from his own school board. He
is then entitled to teach in his own State for life.
The Normal School students of Connecticut are submitted
to State Examination, but in Massachusetts
no outside examination is required. Students who
work satisfactorily through the course, and pass the
final examination, “graduate” at the discretion of
the President, or according to results of an examination
set by the School Board of the city. The
State examination of teachers and most of the final
examinations of the Normal Schools are usually in
academic subjects only. It is not attempted to test
by actual examination the degree of skill in teaching
or governing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Supply of Teachers.</span></h4>

<p>As regards the number of teachers who have been
trained in Normal Schools relatively to the number
who teach in the Common Schools of the State without
previous training, statistics are apt to be misleading,
because, in many cases, Normal Students
do not take the entire course or “graduate.” Out
of 372 students enrolled at New Britain in 1889-1890,
only 77 completed the entire course; in 1890-1891,
only 61 out of 401 graduated; and in 1891-1892,
out of 444 students, only 91 were graduates.
For 1888-1889 Framingham shows 30 graduates out
of 205 present in the school; Salem shows 129 out
of 292; and Bridgewater, 69 out of 232. In all
these schools the courses are two, three or four
years, and if all the students completed the course,
the number of graduates each year would be ½, ⅓, or
¼ respectively of the number of students enrolled.
The Report of School Commissioners for 1888-1889
shows that among 75,529 teachers in the Common
Schools of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, there
were only 1,461 students who completed the Normal
School Course in these States. In all the States,
arrangements are made for teachers who do not go
through the Normal Schools. Certificates of license
to teach in the State for a shorter or longer time
are granted according to results of the State Certificate
Examination. A third-grade certificate, entitling
its owner to teach for a short time, may be exchanged
for a second-grade certificate, when further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
proficiency is shown by re-examination. So a
second-grade certificate may be exchanged for a
life-certificate in many of the States. It should be
borne in mind that these examinations are only in
school subjects.</p>

<p>The fact that in a State such as Massachusetts
the qualifications of teachers in the High and Latin
Schools of Boston is stated merely as “Education
at some respectable college of good standing,” shows
that the necessity for the professional training of
teachers for higher or secondary schools is not at
present fully recognised. Until the last few years,
no Institution especially devoted to the training of
secondary teachers existed in the eastern States,
and those who wished to prepare themselves for the
teaching of the higher branches of subjects had no
other means of training than that offered in the
Normal Schools. At Worcester and Bridgewater,
College and University graduates may take the
pedagogical course as special students, and so prepare
for teaching in the higher schools. At the Indiana
and Illinois Normal Schools, and in other
places, there are courses of study chiefly or entirely
professional, for college or university graduates, if
such present themselves. At Albany, too, where the
standard of admission is high, many of the students
prepare for work in the secondary schools. On the
whole, however, the number of special students preparing
for higher work in the Normal Schools is
very small. In 1891-1892, the Southern Illinois
Normal University had only six special students, the
Terre-Haute Normal School, Indiana, only four; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
we find in the eastern States generally that the
Normal Schools take very little part in the training
of secondary teachers. For the most part Normal
School students are found only in the lower grades
of public schools; and college graduates, even though
untrained, are preferred as teachers in High Schools,
good private schools and academies.</p>

<p>The reason for this is probably to be found in the
nature of the Normal School itself. It, perhaps more
than any other educational institution in America,
has adhered to its old traditions. It was designed
to train teachers for the lower grades of Elementary
Schools, and in the early days was prepared to
accept the only material at hand—would-be
teachers, many of whom possessed few intellectual
qualifications, and almost all were inadequately prepared
for training. But with rising standards of
work, and increased facilities for good preliminary
preparation, the Normal School has not yet closed
its doors to students whose general attainments do
not qualify them to profit by courses in the Science
and Art of Teaching. In one or two cases only is
the standard of college graduation insisted upon, and
in many cases the admission standard is lower than
that required to complete the course in a city High
School. Hence it results that most of the teaching
in High Schools and academies is given into the
hands of professionally untrained teachers—college
graduates, whose scholarship can be relied upon, but
who have no previous technical training, rather than
to trained teachers, whose knowledge of the actual
subject matter of studies may or may not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
thorough. The choice, open to heads of Secondary
Schools when appointing assistants, is, moreover,
not between good scholarship and good training.
Without adequate preparation the training must
be inadequate, and in many cases cramping and
injurious. On the other hand, it is only after the
preliminary preparation has been sound and complete
that the work of training can be carried out
in the best possible way.</p>

<h3><i>CITY NORMAL AND TRAINING SCHOOLS.</i></h3>

<p>The existence of State Normal Schools and City
Training Schools side by side suggests at once a
fact which has an important bearing on educational
questions in the United States—viz., the absolute distinction,
as regards jurisdiction, between schools
outside the limits of a town or city, under the
supervision of a State Board and State Superintendent,
and schools within the city radius, and under
the supervision of a Town or City Superintendent.
In educational matters, the city areas are completely
exempt from State control. Their schools and
training schools are managed by local authorities,
and supplied for the most part by local funds.
Hence it follows that City Normal and Training
Schools show even greater diversity of methods
and arrangement than is found in State Normal
Schools, for their lines of work and efficiency are
entirely dependent upon the respective City Boards
of Education. One effect of local school administration
is distinctly undesirable. The appointment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the principal of the school by the Educational
Board, and the election of that Board by local vote,
produces, in many cities, a tendency to display, in
order to cull popular favour. The “graduation
exercises,” yearly public ceremonies, held in connection
with almost all American schools and
colleges, consist, in the case of training schools, of
various kinds of students’ and children’s exercises,
to which the public are invited. Much valuable
time is taken by the students in preparing essays to
be read and lessons to be given in public; and in
some cases the student or teacher conducts an
examination of her class in the presence of parents
and friends. Several such public exercises I heard,
but in all cases it was evident that true results of
training, or honest results of teaching, were not
demonstrated. The endeavour to impress the audience,
besides involving great waste of time, seems
likely to create an unconscious dishonesty on the
part of teachers, students, and children.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">City Normal Schools.</span></h4>

<p>The City Normal Schools are the local training
schools, maintained by the larger cities for the preparation
of their own teachers.</p>

<p>They require as conditions of admission:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. Residence in the city.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. Satisfactory completion of the high schools course of
the city.</p>

<p>iii. Statement of intention to teach in the schools of the
city.</p>
</div>

<p>To all those who satisfy these conditions, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
eighteen years of age or more, instruction is free,
and completion of the professional course entitles
the student to become a teacher in any of the Common
Schools of the city.</p>

<p>The City Normal Schools of New York and Philadelphia
combine the functions of Normal and High
Schools, admitting students who do not intend to
become teachers to their academic studies, without
requiring of them any professional study or practice
in teaching. The necessity of extending the function
of a Normal School in this way has arisen from
the fact that there are no public High Schools for
girls in these cities.</p>

<p>At the Normal College of the city of New York
there are two separate courses of work:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;i. An academic or classical course of five years.</p>

<p>ii. A normal or training course of four years, with an
optional extra year for specializing in any branch
of manual training.</p>
</div>

<p>In the normal course, two full years are given to
the study of school subjects only. In the third year
two hours a week, in the first half of the fourth
year six hours a week, and in the last half of the
fourth year three hours a week, are given to the
study of pedagogy. At the beginning of the fourth
year, the Normal students enter the training or
practice department connected with the school, and
every third week hear and give lessons, and take
part in criticisms and discussions on teaching. At
the same time, they attend lectures and recitations
in English, Latin, modern languages, natural science,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
drawing and music, chiefly with a view to gaining
an insight into the methods of those subjects. The
college had in December, 1892, 1,868 students, of
whom 460 had belonged to the training department
during the year—<i>i.e.</i>, had observed and actually
taught in the training or practising school. As
large numbers are engaged in observing and teaching
in one practising school, much individual
practice in the actual work of teaching is impossible;
for although the students are divided
into groups for the school work, the groups are
necessarily large. It has been found necessary for
ninety-two students to be in the practising school
at one time, a number too large to allow of much
actual teaching being done by any individual
student. Only a small part of the twelve hours
spent weekly by each student in the practising
school is given to teaching. The remaining time
is given to hearing lessons and observing children.</p>

<p>I noticed a similar need for more practical work
in the Philadelphia Normal School. Here, as in the
New York Normal College, much purely academic
work is done, and very little importance is given to
actual school-room practice. Students are divided
into six sections, each group containing about fifty.
A whole division goes into the practising school at
one time, and stays there for two weeks only. The
remaining thirty-eight weeks of the last school year
are entirely devoted to the study of pedagogical
subjects, psychological methods and drawing.
Kindergarten work is compulsory to all during the
last year. The two weeks which each student<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
spends in the schools are chiefly employed in hearing
lessons, and observing children and teachers. Only
two days in the whole course are spent in actual
teaching. This arrangement of work and distribution
of time in the Philadelphia Normal School is
seen by the city school authorities to be far from
satisfactory, and a scheme has been made out for a
thorough revision of the course. The present school,
which is inadequate for purposes of training, is to
be made into a public High School for girls, and a
new Normal School is to be built, in which three
years are to be devoted to academic, and two years
to professional work; but the two parts are to be
kept entirely distinct. The training course is to
consist of elementary and advanced sections, and
much more time is to be given to actual teaching.</p>

<p>The examinations of the City Normal Schools are
usually conducted by the faculties of the schools,
under the supervision of sub-committees of the
Board of Public Education of the city. In the
Philadelphia School, a certificate is awarded by a
“Committee on the Qualification of Teachers” for
a general average of 85 per cent. on two examinations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;i. In academical subjects, at end of three years.</p>

<p>ii. In professional subjects, at the end of four years.</p>
</div>

<p>An average of 85 per cent. on the teaching in the
school of practice is also required. Two certificates
are awarded for lower averages of marks on work
of the course, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An “Assistant’s Certificate” for average of 70
per cent., and a “Trial Certificate” for less
than an average of 70 per cent. on work in
the school of practice. Such a “Trial Certificate”
is for one year only. If, at the end of
that time, the teaching shall be reported as
satisfactory by the Superintendent of the
Schools, the “Trial Certificate” may be exchanged
for an “Assistant’s Certificate.”</p>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">City Training Schools.</span></h4>

<p>The City Training Schools are purely professional
institutions. They admit only graduates of High
Schools of the city, and give them a course of one
or two years in theory and practice of teaching.
The amount of time given to theory varies a good
deal in the different cities. Practice in teaching is
usually gained in a practising school well equipped
with good teachers, who help and guide the students
in their work. In some instances, however, students
gain their experience by teaching under supervision,
in the schools of the city.</p>

<p>Emphasis of the practical side of the teacher’s
work seems to be a good feature of the training
schools generally. In all the City Training Schools
which I visited much opportunity was given for
actual teaching, and for practically dealing with the
problems of discipline and organization in the
school-room. Such opportunities are multiplied by
the system of substitute service, which seems to be
organized in most of the cities of the United States.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Students of the training schools, during the latter
part of their course, are registered on a substitute
list, and may be called to supply the place of
teachers temporarily absent from the Common
Schools. Responsibility taken for a week, or even
a day, is excellent training for future teachers, and
in cases where permanent vacancies occur the
student who has shown herself capable in such an
emergency is often appointed to the post.</p>

<p>Among the largest and most successful of the
City Training Schools is the Boston Normal and
Rice Training School. This, although a City
Normal School by name, differs in many respects
from the City Normal Schools of New York and
Philadelphia. Its work is strictly professional, and
seems to correspond rather with the Training
Schools of other cities than with those known as
Normal Schools. The Rice Training School offers
an ordinary course of two years, and an advanced
course for further professional work. The practising
school in the same building gives the opportunity to
the students of teaching and observing children, and
beyond this the “Supervisors of Public Instruction”
in the city have made arrangements for allowing
the students to watch and teach in some of the best
Primary and Grammar Schools of Boston. Completion
of the Boston High School course, or college
graduation, exempts from the entrance examination
of the school.</p>

<p>Theoretical instruction in pedagogical subjects is
given in the morning, teaching in the practising
school occupies the afternoon hours. Psychology is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
taken almost every day throughout the course.
Theory of the kindergarten is studied in the second
term, and logic in the third. The history of education
is also taken in outline.</p>

<p>“Methods” of subjects are taught in great detail,
and on the same lines as in the State Normal Schools—viz.,
by means of lessons in the various subjects given
to the students themselves. I heard a very interesting
lesson in methods of arithmetic. A class of
twenty girls were, by very skilful questioning, made
to thoroughly discuss the process of simple addition,
and also the methods of teaching children to realize
numbers greater than ten. I heard, too, very
skilful teaching in methods of English—viz., a
literature lesson, and a first lesson in English composition.
In the literature lesson, the teacher first
reminded her pupils of the various poems and prose
selections studied during the term. After having
given short explanations, she read selections from
other authors. Then the students were asked if
these new selections reminded them of any parts in
the poems already studied, and when the suggested
parts had been quoted, the class was set to discover
whether the similarity was in the subject matter,
the underlying thought or the mode of expression.
Many suggestions were given by the class, and much
interest was aroused. The lesson was a most helpful
illustration of how a teacher should stimulate
her class, and how she should use her materials for
the purpose of training. The study of methods of
training occupies a prominent place in the curriculum
of the school, and includes special work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
illustrative drawing on the blackboard in connection
with the teaching of geography, and the drawing of
plants and animals. As part of the course on gymnastics,
each student, besides studying the theory
and doing daily drill, must act for one term as
leader and teacher of drill, and must criticise drill
lessons.</p>

<p>Practical work in the schools is arranged for each
term. In the first half-year, the students’ work in
the training school consists chiefly in observing
methods of teaching, and hearing lessons, under the
guidance of the critic teacher. She does not begin
to teach in the school until the second term, two
weeks of which she spends in a primary grade, and
two weeks in a higher or grammar grade. In the
third term she spends eight weeks in the schools,
and in the fourth term four weeks. It is usual for
each student, while in the schools, to give two or
three lessons every day, under the supervision of
the class teacher with whom she is placed. The
teacher criticises and suggests in all cases. In the
advanced course, students take up a further study
of the principles of education. They also study the
history of education, give more time to actual
teaching in the schools, and act as substitutes in the
city schools.</p>

<p>In addition to the Boston Training School, there
are fourteen city training schools in the State of
Massachusetts. In all these the time of training is
fixed from one to two years; admission is by the
High School graduation certificate, or an equivalent
entrance examination, and is only at fixed annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
times; a school is attached for practice, and the
teacher at its head conducts the training class.</p>

<p>At the Springfield Training School the course may
be extended to two years. A little academic work
is done in science during the first term. Methods
are treated of by means of lectures and discussions,
and these, with organized observation of children
and a few criticism lessons, constitute the practical
work from September until Christmas. At Christmas,
systematic psychology begins, and also teaching
in the schools for one hour a day. The subjects of
the lessons are chosen by the critic teacher, and the
teaching is in all cases under supervision. At
Easter the student begins to teach three hours a
day, and occasionally has to give lessons in public.
These, however, are not considered as test-lessons.
Certificates to teach in the schools of the city are
granted on the results of an examination, held by
the City Board of Education each year.</p>

<p>At Newhaven, Connecticut, the City Training
School has more than thirty students. The course
is a year in length, the first half of which is devoted
entirely to theoretical subjects, and the last half to
teaching. Here, as at the Worcester Normal
School, I found students being introduced to
methods of psychological experimentation, more
especially in the senses of sight and hearing. It is
interesting to notice that these are special lines of
research in the psychological laboratory of Yale
University. I saw the records of several students
who had been finding the average voice pitch of
thirty children. The tendency in all the psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
teaching here was to make the subject really
experimental, and the results those of actual observation.
The history of education is not taught by
means of set lectures, but topics are announced from
time to time, with references for the students’ reading.
After the class has collected facts on a certain
subject, the teacher supplements the facts already
given by selections from other books, and references
to other parts of the subject. In treating the
history of education in each country, general
chronological order is followed, and the facts of
each period are studied under four heads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Religion, social and political movements; extent
of education; character of education; methods
of education.</p>
</div>

<p>The school has a good library for the students’
use, and also one for the children of the practising
school. Students give one criticism lesson during
the first half-year, and for this they write elaborate
notes under fixed headings prepared by the head of
the department, and the other students hand in, after
the lesson, elaborate criticisms done in a similar way.
Blank schedules with printed headings, such as the
following, are given to students to fill up before
giving the lesson:</p>

<p>I noticed in schedules which had been thus filled
up by students that the notes supplied under the
heading of “Method” consisted entirely of proposed
questions of the teacher, and assumed answers by
the children. Such an item in the prepared plan
of a lesson seemed to me unadvisable, and in many
cases useless. Even if the prepared questions were
asked by the teacher, the answers would not always
be the ones assumed, and the lesson would be stiff,
unnatural, and wanting in spontaneity. Broad lines
of questioning might be indicated in the schedule,
rather than the actual questions to be given. This
would result in much more natural methods of questioning.
The outline for criticism given to other
students is according to the following plan:</p>

<p>The suggestion of these points for criticism indicates
a very complete and thorough analysis of a
lesson. Such an elaborate form of criticism, if employed
occasionally, seems to me good in encouraging
a habit of mental analysis in those who hear the
lesson. It may be useful, too, as a guide to those
unaccustomed to criticising exercises, and may be
helpful in impressing the fact that a lesson is a
very complex thing, difficult to give, and far reaching
in its results. The constant use of rigid forms,
however, either for preparation of lessons, or for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
their criticism, is to be deprecated as stultifying,
and as not adapted to all lessons and all occasions.
It is probable that in many cases valuable criticisms
might be given which would not come under any
of the formal headings, even though the schedule
were as complete as possible. For the last five
months the students work entirely under the direction
of teachers of the practising school. Plans of
work and lesson-subjects are discussed with the
teacher, and when the lessons are over, private
criticisms only are given. Each student learns to
make her own maps, charts and pictures, which she
takes with her when she leaves the school.</p>

<p>At the end of the course of training, an elaborate
report of the student’s work and standing is issued
as regards her standards; enthusiasm; force; manner;
language; writing; questioning; power of
illustration; originality; interest; thoroughness;
control.</p>

<p>A certificate qualifying to teach in the schools of
the city is given to those who complete the training
course satisfactorily, and who gain an average of 70
per cent. on examinations at the end of the year.</p>

<p>At Pawtucket, I saw a training school of from
seven to nine students, with an excellent model and
practising school attached. The course lasts for one
and a half years. For a whole year, the class has
instruction in theoretical subjects in the mornings,
with observation of children and some lesson-giving
in the afternoon. The last six months are spent by
the students in the actual charge of children. Each
student works under a Model School teacher, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
one week during the half-year has sole charge and
responsibility of the class.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">City Training Classes.</span></h4>

<p>Closely allied to the work of the Training Schools
is that done by City Training Classes. These are
usually found in the smaller towns or cities of the
various States. The general features of the Training
Classes are the same as those of the City
Training Schools. The differences are mainly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) No special model or practising school is attached, but
the students gain their experience by teaching classes in city
or town schools.</p>

<p>(2) The work of training is carried out, not by a specially
appointed person, as in the Training Schools, but by the
Superintendent of Schools of the district, who holds classes
in professional subjects, and arranges and criticises the work
of the students.</p>
</div>

<p>The members of the Training Classes, while
under the general guidance of the heads of the
schools, where they act as assistants, are helped and
instructed in methods of teaching various subjects
by the Town Supervisors of Instruction, appointed
for those special subjects. The appointment of
supervisors in drawing, singing, reading, etc., whose
sole work is to visit the schools and conduct and
examine classes, gives unity to the methods in
the various schools of a town, and affords much
practical help to the student-teachers in the various
schools.</p>

<p>At Quincy, Massachusetts, there is a training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
class of thirty students. The pupil teachers act as
assistants in the schools, receiving no compensation,
except the guidance of experienced teachers, and
theoretical instruction from the superintendent.
They usually teach in several grades during the
year, but those who show special aptitude or wish
to teach in any particular grade are allowed an
alternative of remaining in that grade. At the
Coddington school, one of the training schools for
the Quincy Training Classes, I heard very good
lessons given in reading, phonics, number, English
and geography. A reading lesson, given to ten or
twelve children about seven years old, was to teach
one new word, “Flag.” The class stood around the
teacher at one part of the wall slate. After carefully
revising many of the words learnt in previous
lessons, the teacher drew a flag on the board. Then
she wrote the word as a whole, underneath the
drawing. Then she told a short story about a flag,
wrote the word in different coloured chalks, wrote
sentences involving only known words and the new
word “flag.” When the children could read these
sentences easily, they were made to pick out the
word “flag.” Some were allowed to erase the word,
some to write it again. Every possible device was
used in the lesson to associate the complete written
expression with the spoken word and the idea. At
the end of twenty minutes, when the association
was complete, the new word “flag” was written
among the list of known words, kept constantly on
the board, and the children were sent to their seats.
I noticed in all the reading lessons in which words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and sentences were taught as wholes, that clever
teachers constantly used the device of erasing the
word or sentence to be taught. This, when skilfully
done, secures concentration of attention on
each word, by allowing the children only a limited
time to note its general shape, before being required
to represent it on the board or slate. The constant
erasure and repeated re-writing of a word ensure
repeated short acts of intense attention on the part
of the children, and so help greatly in the learning
of the new word. A lesson in “number” or arithmetic,
given to the same class, was devoted to
problems in addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division of numbers below ten. Many devices
were used for interesting the class. The children
were sent to work at different parts of the wall
slate, and were encouraged to contribute problems
for the class. The general use of the wall slate is
seen to be of great advantage, especially in such
lessons as these. By means of it, supervision of
individual work is very easy, and corrections can be
made valuable to the whole class.</p>

<p>The Training Classes of the State of New York
show more uniformity of courses and methods than
those of many of the other States. This is due to
their organization by the State Superintendent, who
issues regulations and a definite course of study.
The course is a short one, from ten to thirteen weeks.
Two hours each day is given to instruction.
Methods in reading, spelling, number, language and
primary geography are studied, and observation and
criticism of lessons is a definite part of the work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Actual teaching is done wherever possible; but this
is not a requisite. The time given to each subject
is apportioned somewhat on the same principles as
in the Normal Schools—viz., one subject is followed
up for a very short time, another is taken up in the
same way, and then another. On this plan, only a
few days can be given to some subjects. The syllabus
of work for 1889 gives four days to laws of
mental development, seventeen days to school
economy, ten days to the history of education, and
four days to school law. Other set times are given
to Methods. Such a course, lasting for a very short
time, and including so many subjects, cannot but be
inadequate and superficial when used as the only
means of training. The experience gained in such
a way is not sufficient in itself to qualify for responsible
work in a town school. This is shown by
the fact that those who have taken a course in the
training class of a city are often expected to gain
experience elsewhere, before taking responsible work
in that city. In many instances, students are urged
to take Normal School courses as well.</p>

<p>It may indeed be stated generally, that the work
of Training Classes is to supplement a longer and
more thorough course in training, rather than to
train. Training Classes, for the most part, provide
practice under supervision for those who have already
gained some insight into the science of education
and methods of teaching, but the small
amount of time given to other sides of training
prevents their work being at all adequate as the
sole preparation for teachers. Training Classes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
exist, and will exist, to meet the needs of those
would-be teachers who, in small towns, where there
is neither Normal nor Training School, cannot afford
to leave their homes to prepare for their work. The
urgent demand for trained teachers for all the Common
Schools has resulted in the establishment of
many institutions, which, while fulfilling a present
need, are existing under conditions which must prohibit
work of the best kind. Among such institutions
we must enrol the City Training Classes.</p>

<p>It is a noticeable fact, that in both Training Schools
and Training Classes, the beginners usually practise
first in the lowest grades. It is considered easier
to teach little children than older ones, and less
dangerous to the pupils. Indeed, the heads of many
schools, far from adopting the theory that the primary
teaching should be in the hands of the most
skilled and efficient teachers, give their youngest
classes into the care of those disqualified to teach
in higher grades, on account of lack of knowledge,
or want of skill. It may be urged in support of
the plan of allowing teachers unqualified for other
grades of teaching to become teachers in the primary
schools, that the knowledge actually used in
the teaching of little children is much less than that
needed for work with elder children, and that certain
devices for keeping children quiet, and for
interesting them, can be followed empirically by the
unskilful teacher. But this argument, instead of
sanctioning the practice so commonly adopted,
would serve to show that it is in the lower grades
that bad teaching can remain undetected, and results,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
rather than means, made criteria of success.
Much of the growth of the child-mind, in its early
stages, depends on the teacher’s width of interest, a
width only secured by a thorough knowledge of the
subjects taught, and a broad range of subjects.
This breadth of interest not only influences the
class, but reacts on the teacher; for teachers of
young children, having little necessity to make constant
intellectual efforts, stand in great danger of
becoming intellectually narrowed.</p>

<p>Partly as a result of the fact that most of the
students in Normal and City Training Schools are
prepared for work as primary teachers, and that
others who hope eventually to teach in higher
grades must first gain their experience in primary
grades, we find that much more attention is given
to primary methods than to methods of the Grammar
School. This is true not only in Practising
Schools and Model Schools, but elsewhere.</p>

<p>Therefore, the most rapid progress in American
Education has been connected with elementary
teaching. The present movement to reform the
curriculum and methods of the Grammar School is
only of recent development.</p>

<h3><i>UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS OF PEDAGOGY.</i></h3>

<p>The pedagogical courses connected with the
Universities of the United States differ so much in
organization and scope, and in the nature of their
connection with the University, that it is impossible
to consider them under one comprehensive title,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
unless the exact meaning of the term “University
Department” be defined. In the present case, the
title “University Department of Pedagogy” is used
to include all higher courses of study in philosophy,
psychology, history, science or art of education
established by Universities or Colleges of high
standing, in definite recognition of the fact that the
work of secondary teaching requires distinct and
special professional or technical preparation, beyond
a sound general education. Such instruction may
be given in connection with Chairs of Pedagogy by
series of lectures on science and art of teaching,
theory and practice of teaching, etc., or it may be
so complete as to constitute a school of pedagogy in
itself, thoroughly organized and equipped to carry
out professional training in all its branches. Pedagogical
study may be a so-called “elective”—viz.,
one of the subjects chosen by the student to count
towards his degree, or it may be a course for post-graduates
only. It may consist merely of courses
in special pedagogy or “methods,” by the various
professors of different subjects in a University, or it
may be chiefly the study of education from a
scientific standpoint, as in Clark University, Massachusetts,
where experimental and physiological
psychology is pursued, not with the view of meeting
the needs of intending teachers, but of offering opportunities
of thorough study to scientific experts,
whose results may be of great value to education in
general. The number of Universities or Colleges in
the United States which report pedagogical courses
of some kind is 114. In many of these, however, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
work is mostly of the Normal School type, with a
view to prepare for teaching in the Grammar Schools
of the State, and the certificate of proficiency given
on completion of the course is not such as to entitle
the work to be called “Higher Instruction in the
Theory and Art of Teaching.” Leaving such departments
out of consideration, as not belonging to
the field of higher education, the departments of
pedagogy in connection with Universities may, for
convenience, be considered under two heads:</p>

<p>1. Those in connection with State Universities.</p>

<p>2. Those connected with other endowed Universities
or Colleges of high standing.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Departments of State Universities.</span></h4>

<p>State Universities, founded in accordance with
the resolution, “Schools and the means of education
shall for ever be encouraged,” have naturally been
looked up to as the institutions more fitted than any
other to supply higher instruction in the science
and art of teaching. The first was established as
the result of the Ordinance of 1787, by which two
townships of land were appropriated from the
North-West Territory for the support of a State
University. Since then, twenty-eight States of the
Union have set apart funds, derived from the sale
of State lands, for the founding and endowing of
institutions for higher education. These universities,
gradually increasing in number and influence, and
spreading from their origin in Ohio both west and
east, are dependent for the most part for their
students upon the city High Schools and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
secondary schools; and the efficiency of their work
depends greatly upon the efficiency of the preparatory
work done in these schools. It is, therefore, to
the interest of the State Universities to secure that
the secondary schools are well equipped and well
taught, and from this point of view one of the
distinctive lines of work of a State University should
be the professional preparation of secondary teachers.
The University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, was the
first State University to recognise the necessity of
this work. In 1879 it established a Chair to give instruction
in science and art of teaching, and since
then, Training and Normal departments, or courses
in pedagogy, have been established in the State
Universities of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri,
Nevada, N. Dakota, Ohio, Washington and others.</p>

<p>In some Universities the work of training is entirely
given over to the pedagogical department and
the professor of pedagogy. In some, there are no
purely professional departments, but “Teachers’
Courses” are organized in various subjects of the
college curriculum. These courses are given by
college professors of the various subjects, and deal
with the different methods of treating the subject.
In some State Universities, however, training is
provided both in pedagogical departments and
“Teachers’ Courses”; and good work in both is
required before a student can gain a “Teacher’s
Diploma.” Where the two parts of the work are
maintained harmoniously together, they must
greatly strengthen each other, and advantages
must accrue both to the students and to the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of training generally. In such a case the scientific,
but more or less theoretical instruction of the professedly
pedagogical department of the University
is supplemented by the practical instruction, which
is the result of the experience of experts in the
respective subjects. The discussion of “methods”
in any subject, with a specialist, who is constantly
teaching that subject, must be most valuable to the
future teacher, and especially so when the specialist
can illustrate his methods by actual class work, and
the learner is himself somewhat of a specialist. The
existence of these double lines of work is also important,
where it occurs, as illustrating unity of
opinion among the presidents and professors of
colleges as regards the needs and means of training
of secondary teachers. Thus it will help on the
cause of secondary training generally.</p>

<p>One of those State Universities which recognise
these two distinctive branches of professional training
is the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor.
Work in both departments has been required in
order to gain a “Teacher’s Diploma,” ever since
the pedagogical course was arranged in 1879. The
student must have completed three courses offered
by the professor of pedagogy—one a practical course
in the art of teaching and governing, school hygiene,
school law, etc.; one a theoretical and critical course
on the principles of teaching or applied psychology;
and one other course which may be either:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>History of education, ancient and mediæval.<br>
History of education, modern, or,<br>
School Management.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>He must also have taken a “Teacher’s Course” in
connection with one of the subjects in the college
curriculum—work which implies not only extra
professional instruction in methods by the college
professor, but also a special examination in the
subject matter of study. Beyond the courses of
study already enumerated as belonging to the Department
of Science and Art of Teaching in the
Michigan University, there is one on the comparative
study of educational systems, and a section for
seminary work. This seminary work, taken up in
pedagogy, as in other subjects, only towards the
completion of the course, is very much on the lines
of the German “Seminar.” It is work of research
and discussion, done with the help of the educational
library. Special points are taken up by the students
and worked out. The teacher guides the work and
reading, and generally conducts the Seminary. As
regards the time devoted to different parts of the
pedagogical curriculum, four hours a week are
given to each of the courses on the art of teaching
and the principles of teaching, three hours a week
to each of the history courses and those on school
supervision, and two hours a week to the other
optional subjects. The required course may be
taken among the graduate or post-graduate studies.
“Teachers’ Diplomas” are presented on graduation,
provided the prescribed course has been taken. A
“Teachers’ Certificate” given by the Faculty, on
the gaining of degree and diploma, qualifies to teach
in any school of the State.</p>

<p>At the State University, Illinois, the course in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
pedagogy is work which counts towards a degree.
It is placed among one of the major or principal
subjects of the “restricted electives,” that is, one of
six subjects, each occupying six terms, two subjects
of which must be chosen by the student for graduation
work. Pedagogy is suggested as part of the
work of the third and fourth year in the classical
course, and when taken up for a third and fourth
year, after any ordinary “Two Years’ Course,” it
constitutes a course in philosophy and pedagogy.
The different branches of pedagogy taken up in this
way are:</p>

<p>Educational psychology, hygiene, philosophy of
education, history of education, school supervision.</p>

<p>The “Pedagogical Seminary” is open only to
students who have taken two other pedagogical
courses. Psychology, school hygiene, and school
supervision, constitute full courses for a term—the
rest are half courses. In connection with the Philosophical
Department is a course of lectures and
laboratory work in experimental psychology. Apparatus
has been purchased and considerably used
in making psychological experiments.</p>

<p>In the University of Missouri there are two
distinct courses, elementary and advanced. The
elementary course corresponds very much to a
Normal School course. The subjects for the first
year’s study are chiefly English, algebra, physiology,
zoology, botany, physical geography, rhetoric. In
the second year, pedagogics, including applied
psychology, history and school organization, are
taken up with history, literature, physics, chemistry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and civil government. Drawing and elocution are
required subjects during all but one term of the
course. The certificate at the end of the elementary
course qualifies the holder to teach for two years in
any public school of the State. The advanced
course leads on to the degree of bachelor of pedagogics.
The required work in this department may
be taken by students who are preparing for degrees
in other courses, or by those who have already a
degree conferred by this or any approved University.
The graduate students may, by selecting four of
the offered subjects, and devoting five hours a week
to the pedagogical work, complete the course in one
year. Others, take certain prescribed courses, and
certain optional courses in pedagogics, during the
third and fourth years of their ordinary graduate
work. The degree entitles to a life-certificate to
teach in any of the public schools of the State. It
is noticeable, in connection with the prescribed
courses in this University, that the study of education,
historically, comes before the consideration of
theory or philosophy of education and its application
in school work. The elective or optional studies
are four—viz., school systems of Europe; school
systems of the cities and States of the United
States; the educational theories of Herbert Spencer;
the philosophy of Froebel.</p>

<p>Of the other State Universities, some make pedagogics
a complete course for graduates or undergraduates,
while some, as at Missouri, make it an
elective study during the third and fourth years
of an ordinary graduate course. Where two complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
courses exist—an elementary and an advanced—in
the same department, the distinction is based
chiefly on the difference of qualification needed for
admission. Students qualified to enter the University
may pursue the elementary course; only
those of the third year or fourth year, or graduates,
may take up the advanced course. As a rule, the
students of the elementary course teach in the
Primary or Grammar Schools, those of the advanced
courses become teachers of secondary schools and
colleges.</p>

<p>The State Universities of America, as a whole,
follow, more or less strictly, the lines of German
Universities. This is not only so as regards organization
merely, but as regards methods of study, and
lines of thought. In no department is the German
influence more seen than in that of pedagogics,
where methods of the German “Seminar” are increasingly
used and valued by professors and advanced
students. Few State Universities having
pedagogical departments would be found which had
not begun to use Seminar methods. In many
Universities, a “Seminar room,” in which is a
pedagogical reference library, is set apart especially
for research and conference in matters educational.
A natural accompaniment of these methods is much
study of German pedagogical theory, and a constant
tendency to emphasize and elaborate German lines
of thought. The two great Schools in American
psychology to-day, both of which are making rapid
strides in progress, and influencing the whole of
American education to an important extent, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the Herbartians and the Experimental Psychologists.
Both had their beginnings in German Universities.</p>

<p>The most modern feature of German University
Departments of Pedagogy is, however, one which
has not yet been adopted by American State Universities.
A means of connection between the
theoretical and practical sides of training, by the
establishment of a practising school attached to the
University, has been made at Jena for some time.
Such a connection would be of the greatest value
to American State University Departments, but
until now actual practical departments have not
existed. The instruction in university departments
of pedagogy, although such as to be of the greatest
possible value and stimulation as a theoretical basis
for teaching and organizing in secondary schools,
is however incomplete unless opportunities are also
supplied of gaining actual experience in teaching.
A practising school, organized as a part of the
University, and having as its principal one of the
University Faculty, might, besides affording such
a practising ground for secondary teachers, be the
means of supplying tested facts to the teaching
world in general, and would greatly help the University
Department to fulfil its true function—that
of stimulating teachers and unifying education in
the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">University Departments of Pedagogy in the
Eastern States.</span></h4>

<p>The study of pedagogy in connection with the
universities and colleges of the Eastern States is a
department of work of comparatively recent origin.
The conservative attitude of the older Universities,
such as Harvard and Yale, with regard to the
recognition of the claims of pedagogy to be a
science, and the needs of distinctly professional instruction
for those who intend to become teachers
in higher schools and colleges, has resulted in the
fact that the training of secondary teachers has,
until a few years ago, been almost entirely restricted
to the Western State Universities. It is remarkable,
however, that since the older educational
institutions of the Eastern States have recognised
education as a science, rapid progress has been
made, and one finds on surveying the work of
university departments of pedagogy as a whole
certain features which, when further developed,
will possibly cause university instruction to be the
most valuable means of training secondary teachers.
Among such lines of work, already begun in these
pedagogical departments, are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. Supervision of secondary school work.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. Stimulation of all teachers by research work in educational
matters.</p>

<p>iii. The acknowledgment by scientific workers in the
field of pedagogy and psychology of the results of
teachers’ observations of children in the school-room,
as helpful to the scientific researches of the
laboratory.</p>

<p>&#160;iv. Preparation and stimulation of professors of pedagogy,
and of teachers for higher schools and colleges.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>A very early attempt was made in Brown University,
Providence, Rhode Island, to arrange courses
in theory and methods of teaching, but the movement
was not successful. Little actual work in the
training of secondary teachers was done in the
Eastern States, until the Industrial Education Association
of New York City, feeling the demand for
skilful teachers in manual training, began to organize
plans for preparing them for their work, and
sending them out daily to teach in the schools. At
the beginning of 1889, the work had developed so
much, not only in connection with one branch of
training, but many, that the institution gained a
provisional charter from the Board of Regents of
the University of the State of New York, under
the name of the New York College for the Training
of Teachers.</p>

<p>In 1892 the charter of the New York College for
the Training of Teachers was made absolute, and
the name changed to Teachers’ College. An agreement
was also made, whereby certain pedagogical
courses in the Teachers’ College are considered as
courses in the Faculty of Philosophy at Columbia
University, New York, and count towards a Columbia
University degree. By the same agreement,
qualified students of the Teachers’ College are
admitted to the courses in philosophy and pedagogy
at Columbia University. In this way we may regard
the Teachers’ College as the newest of University
departments, although, on the other hand,
it has developed and become a most important and
successful means of secondary training, quite apart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
from any connection with a college or university.
The courses in pedagogy given at Columbia University,
and open to students of the Teachers’
College, are:</p>

<p>Candidates for the A.B. degree of Columbia University
may specialize for the last year in the
department of pedagogy. They are required to
take two subjects, one as major or principal subject,
one as minor subject. A third optional subject may
be taken.</p>

<p>To gain a Diploma of the Teachers’ College, a
two years’ course of study is required. This
includes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;i. Elements of Psychology—“a course to give skill in
description and explanation of mental phenomena
and insight into the observing and training of
children.”</p>

<p>&#160;vii. Physical training.</p>

<p>viii. Special methods of one subject of study.</p>
</div>

<p>The college is distinctly and solely a professional
school. There is no direct instruction in the subject
matter of study, the admission qualification being
such as to exclude all persons who have not had
a satisfactory secondary education. Each college
department provides training in the principles and
practice of teaching the subjects which more especially
belong to it; but all instruction is entirely
from the standpoint of the teacher. It is particularly
stated in connection with this teaching, that
no student is admitted to a course in the methods
of any particular subject unless he can show himself
to be proficient in the subject matter of that
branch of instruction. For those not qualified,
by training or academic standing, to pursue the
ordinary work of the college, it has been found
advisable to arrange an introductory course to
occupy one year. The preparatory course includes
the study of English, an introduction to science,
either drawing, domestic science, or wood-carving,
and either constructive geometry, with the solution
of original problems, or one branch of science with
laboratory work. I spent several days in this
college and heard some of the teaching in psychology,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and in science. The psychology and history
of education are both two years’ courses. In psychology
the students begin by learning to make
records of their individual observation of children.
The chief use of psychology to the teacher is regarded
as the making him conscious of processes
of thought, which before might have been accurate,
but were not known. As the end of education is
assumed to be a moral end, in so far as it has to
do with character and conduct, the will is made the
basis of educational psychology and is treated first
in order. One advantage of such an order of treatment
is that the practical value of the study of
psychology to education can be early shown. As
the whole question of education is a question of the
guiding and controlling of action, great importance
is given to the practical study of action in its three
phases of instinct, will and habit. Each of these is
followed out as far as possible by means of the
observation of children at play, or by the study of
the student’s own willed movements. All questions
of physiological psychology are avoided as much as
possible in the study of psychology for educational
purposes, the two reasons given being:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;i. That most students have not a sufficient knowledge of
physiology to take up physiological psychology.</p>

<p>ii. That those who have a sufficient knowledge of physiology
find the correlation difficult. In beginning
to study psychology, the two aspects of one set of
facts and their bearings upon each other cannot be
easily seen. Much work in both sciences is needed
before good work can be done in physiological
psychology.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>The students use Sully, James, and Höffding as
text-books. The lines of work, however, are not
those of any particular writer or school. The
students have ample opportunities of wide reading
and research, not only in psychology, but in all
branches of pedagogy. These are afforded by the
Bryson Pedagogical Library in the college building.
This library, founded in connection with the
Teachers’ College, for the purpose of affording opportunities
of research to students of the college,
is open to all teachers of the city and to the public
generally. It contains 5,000 volumes, including
books on pedagogy and connected subjects, text-books
of all kinds, and the current literary, scientific
and educational periodicals published in America
and Europe.</p>

<p>In the study of the history of education, the plan
adopted is a thorough and exhaustive treatment of
one or two great educational reformers, with mere
outline sketches of others. The reformers specially
considered are regarded, not only as educators, but
in all other possible aspects. Their lives and works,
their ideas, the contemporary history of their own
and other countries, are fully discussed. When this
has been done, all other facts of educational history
are as far as possible compared with, and illustrated
by, the facts connected with the reformer who has
been specially considered. Such a method seems
very stimulating and interesting to the student, and
much more satisfactory, than a general treatment of
the whole, suggested by many text-books on the
history of education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Methods of chemistry, physics, physiology-botany,
geology, are taught by means of actual lessons
in the various subjects, given by the heads of
departments and their assistants, to children in the
practising school. Students are required to observe
the teaching, to attend lectures and discussions upon
the methods pursued, to learn the art of experimenting,
and to prepare themselves for directing laboratories.
They are also guided and helped in making
a careful inspection of the science teaching in the
public schools of the city. In addition to this, they
are introduced to some of the practical problems of
science teaching in the school-room, such as the
difficulties of teaching science without a laboratory,
or without fixed times for experimenting. All
students who take science as their major or principal
subject are required also to take courses in:—(i.)
The use of tools for constructing home-made apparatus;
(ii.) fundamental principles of drawing and
their applications for students who take special work
in other departments; (iii.) the specified courses in
psychology, history of education, and science and
art of teaching; (iv.) outlines of the lives and work
of eminent scientists, as illustrating methods of
scientific research. A Time-Table for the Two
Years’ Course in Science is as follows:—</p>

<p>The practice department of the Teachers’ College
is one of its most important features, for a fundamental
assumption is that practice is the key-note of
all training, that no one can consider himself trained
who has not taught, and that the future teacher
must observe good teaching, and must teach under
normal conditions. The Horace Mann School for
the observation and practice of the students of
the Teachers’ College comprises kindergarten, primary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
grammar and high school grades. The heads
of departments arrange the teaching of the students,
and great care is exercised in keeping the school
efficient, as the observation of good teaching is
considered only second in importance to actual practice.</p>

<p>I heard a botany lesson in the practising school,
given by the instructor in methods of botany. The
class, numbering about twelve children, of about ten
years of age, was furnished with lenses, and needles,
and a plentiful supply of flowers. Each child was
required to see and examine all the flowers that
were given to him, to describe carefully and exactly
what he had observed, and to take nothing for
granted. The methods adopted were such as to
make the children original investigators, and the
attitude of the teacher towards her subject was such
as to develop a spirit of reverence in the children,
and to arouse an interest æsthetic as well as scientific.
No technical terms were used in descriptions.
The botany lessons are adapted to the different seasons
of the year. For example, the scheme of work
for the Autumn term is:—</p>

<p>The herbarium is not much used, but in autumn
each child and student brings a specimen of one tree
or plant. All the specimens are kept and are used
for the study of seeds during the winter. Twigs
are brought into the school-room and made to grow
in water, seeds are grown in shavings, and plants of
all kinds are watched during the year.</p>

<p>The work in geology is a special feature of the
practising school. Courses of work have been
adapted by the head of department to the lowest
grades of the grammar school—viz., to children about
nine years old. The work is closely connected with
the geography teaching, and children are encouraged
to collect specimens of different kinds of building
stone they see, or to bring any other specimens of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
rock or minerals. Trays of quartz, felspar and mica
are provided for each child, for beginning practical
work in geology. After examination of these minerals,
granite is studied, and afterwards gneiss, as
leading the way to the general history of rocks.
Slag structures are given for examination, as specimens
to illustrate the effects of heat. Artificial
geodes and lavas are also studied, when connecting
the history of rocks with their structure. Students
who are preparing to become specialist teachers in
geology have special work with the children. They
prepare lessons under the guidance of the teacher—submitting
written notes of the subject matter, but
talking over with their head of department the proposed
methods of dealing with the facts. They
have also special laboratory work, in constructing
simple apparatus, and making maps, charts and
drawings.</p>

<p>The physiology lesson I heard was given to a high
school class, by the director of the department of
physiology. It was a revision lesson, conducted
with the special object of making the class discover
the general position of Man in the Animal Kingdom.
The particular features I noticed about the lesson
were:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(i.) No technical terms were used in description, if the
required meaning could be expressed in ordinary language.</p>

<p>(ii.) Any difficulty as regards animal structure which
arose during the process of classification was settled by
actual reference to the museum specimen at hand. The doubt
as to whether a fish might be said to have a brain was
settled by inspection of a haddock’s brain, brought from the
museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>(iii.) Great care was exercised by the teacher in order to
prevent hasty or incorrect inferences being drawn.</p>

<p>(iv.) There was constant reference to text-books. The
pupils had been taught to use a reference library.</p>
</div>

<p>It is evident to those who have watched the
movement of the training of secondary teachers in
the Eastern States that the Teachers’ College of
New York has done a work peculiarly its own. It
was organized on the present lines, to combat the
idea, even still existent to some extent, that college
graduation equips for successful teaching. It has
done this, not by emphasizing the value of professional
training in itself, apart from its connection
with scholastic equipment, but by insisting that the
secondary teacher can only be fully prepared for his
work when careful scholastic preparation is supplemented
by a consideration of principles and methods
of teaching, and by actual class work. Much of the
successful work of the Teachers’ College is probably
due to the thorough preparation required before beginning
work, and to the maturity of the students
who take the courses. With such material, and
under such conditions, it is possible to make training
thorough and very valuable. This is especially so
in an institution, such as this, which can extend
its interests, and broaden its outlook, by alliance
with a University like Columbia, securing by this
means the philosophical as well as the practical
standpoint.</p>

<p>The School of Pedagogy of the University of the
City of New York, established to give opportunities
of higher training to graduates of colleges or of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Normal Schools, differs fundamentally from other
departments of Universities already considered, in
only offering its pedagogical degrees to those persons
who can show evidence of three or four years’ successful
teaching experience. This is a necessary
qualification for admittance to the junior or senior
pedagogical course of the University. A student who
has a college degree, and who is credited with a sufficient
number of attendances during two years’
membership of the senior class, becomes “Doctor of
Pedagogy,” after passing an examination on five
prescribed courses of work, and presenting a satisfactory
thesis on some educational subject. Students
of the junior class are required to pass an examination
in four subjects, and to attend the required number of
lectures during one year, in order to obtain the
degree of “Master of Pedagogy.” The courses
studied are:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(i.) History of Education from Socrates to the present
time (lectures and Seminar).</p>

<p>(ii.) Psychology and Ethics, special attention being paid
to the Physiological Psychology and the Psychology of Experiment.</p>

<p>(iii.) Institutes of Education, including—</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Educational values; incentives; co-ordination of
studies; school hygiene; school organization;
child-study; methods.</p>
</div>

<p>(iv.) Educational classics and æsthetics.</p>

<p>(v.) Systems of Education:—European, American,
National, State, County, City, District.</p>
</div>

<p>Opportunities are given for visiting schools in the
city, and observing teachers and children, but no
practice department is connected with the University.</p>

<p>At Cornell University, at Ithaca, New York, systematic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
instruction in pedagogy is given as a part
of the Department of Philosophy. There is a
professor of pedagogy, who gives courses of lectures
on:—Institutes of Education; School Systems and
Organization; Logic and Methodology; History
of Education. Simple problems for experimental
investigation in the psychological laboratory are
discussed. Pedagogical conferences, somewhat on
the lines of the German “Conferenz,” are arranged,
for criticism of school reports and plans of teaching
various subjects; and seminaries of pedagogy and
psychology have been instituted for laboratory work
and original research. Beyond these strictly professional
courses, there are courses in English, mathematics,
Latin, etc., with direct reference to those
who wish to become teachers in these subjects.
Attendances at such courses counts towards a
“Teachers’ Certificate.” The “Teachers’ Certificate”
is given to graduates of Cornell University,
who have successfully pursued the first course on the
Science and Art of Teaching, or that portion of it
which relates to the general theory of education;
and have also attained marked proficiency in a course
of five hours’ advanced work per week, for two years,
in each subject for which the “Teachers’ Certificate”
is given.</p>

<p>At Syracuse University, New York, pedagogy is
an elective subject during the third terms of the
third and fourth university year, for those who take
the philosophical course. There are also Normal
Courses given by the university professors in their
various subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>The introduction of pedagogy as a definite branch
of the philosophical department at Harvard University,
is perhaps one of the most important movements
in the progress and development of the Science of
Teaching in America. In establishing its course,
“adapted to the purpose of teachers and persons
intending to become teachers,” Harvard has made
recognition of the fact that something more than
pure scholarship is needed to produce the successful
teacher or professor. Accordingly, it has established
two departments of training:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;i. Strictly professional courses in educational theory, history
of educational theories and practice, lectures
on the management of public schools and academies,
and on the curriculum of the public schools; and a
seminary course for advanced students.</p>

<p>ii. Other courses in methods, in connection with actual
university instruction in the different parts of the
curriculum.</p>
</div>

<p>Connected with the lectures on methods, and the
organization and management of public schools, is
the systematic inspection of designated schools by
students, and a detailed report on some phase of
school life observed there. Each student is required
to make a comparative study of the teaching of a
chosen subject, in all the grades of at least two
schools; or he may make a study of supervision and
discipline in two schools. Students must also make
a comparative study of not less than three city
school systems, of three State school systems, and
of the school system of England, France, and Germany.
This work of inspecting and reporting is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
considered a very important part of the pedagogical
course.</p>

<p>The courses in methods, given by the professors
of different college departments, are conducted by
means of lectures and conferences in connection with
Greek, Latin, English, German, French, history,
mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology,
geology and geography. Most of these “Teachers’
Courses” require attendance at some other college
course in the same subject, where the professor illustrates
his own method. In a few cases, attendance
at lessons in the specified subjects, in schools near
the University, is required.</p>

<p>The courses in pedagogy have, until the present
year, been closed to all but graduates. Lately,
however, the regulations have been changed, and
pedagogical work may now count towards a degree.</p>

<p>There is no opportunity given to the Harvard
pedagogical students for actual teaching; but the
connection brought about between the college department
and the secondary schools, by the constant
attendance of students in the school-rooms of the
neighbourhood, may possibly develop into a system
wherein trained students may act as substitutes in
these schools. Quite apart, however, from this
possible future connection, there is even now an
important practical relationship between Harvard
University and some of the secondary schools—viz.,
that of supervision. In establishing a system of
examination of the teaching in such schools as make
application, Harvard has acknowledged the important
principle that chief among the functions of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
university is that of directing and stimulating
secondary education.</p>

<p>The Department of Education at Clark University,
Worcester, Massachusetts, is a branch of the
Department of Psychology. While doing much to
advance the cause of the professional training of
teachers, it does not strictly adapt its courses to the
wants of the future secondary teacher. The fact
that Clark University, unlike any other University
in the United States, exists solely for the purpose
of research, and admits only graduates as its
students, determines that the pedagogical work
shall also have a special character, well marked off
from that of any other university. The department
is purely one of higher pedagogy. Its aim is stated
to be twofold:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;i. To give instruction and training to those who are preparing
to be professors of pedagogy, superintendents,
or teachers in higher institutions.</p>

<p>ii. To make scientific contributions to education.</p>
</div>

<p>The work pursued is in six courses, with an additional
seminary course. These are:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. Present status and problems of higher education in
America and Europe.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. Outline of systematic psychology.</p>

<p>iii. Organization of schools in Europe. Typical schools
and typical foundations.</p>

<p>&#160;iv. School hygiene.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;v. Educational reforms.</p>

<p>&#160;vi. Motor education of children, involving the study of
writing and drawing, manual training, play, and
gymnastics.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Pedagogical Seminary</i>, an educational magazine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
edited by Dr. Stanley Hall, the President of
Clark University, exists chiefly for the purpose of
publishing results of work in this department.
There is a special pedagogical library for research,
and a complete collection of the current educational
literature of America and Europe.</p>

<p>Among the other departments of psychology,
there are many of great interest to the student of
higher pedagogy.</p>

<p>Some of these are:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For investigation in these departments, there are
four psychological laboratories, a neurological laboratory,
and an anthropological laboratory. Opportunities
are also given to students to observe
patients in State and city lunatic hospitals, and in
institutions for the defective and criminal classes.
The departments of research, most closely bearing
upon the teacher’s work, are perhaps those of
experimental psychology and neurology. Investigations
on muscle and brain fatigue, the diurnal
variations of mental vigour, the memory of children,
etc., bring results important to the teacher, and
especially so when carried out as at Clark University,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
by experts in scientific experiment. The
<i>American Journal of Psychology</i>, edited by Dr.
Stanley Hall, and published quarterly, contains the
results of many of the researches in the psychological
laboratories of Clark University.</p>

<p>It is to the contribution of new scientific facts to
the educational world that Clark University chiefly
devotes itself, and in doing this valuable work it
has shown itself quite willing to acknowledge the
results of observation and experiment of a very
different kind from its own—viz., that of parents and
teachers in the home and school. The records of
the observation of children made by the students of
the Worcester Normal School are given to Dr.
Stanley Hall to be used in any way that may help
true scientific research on the subject. It is evident
that results gain by approaching the same problems
from the practical and scientific standpoints, will be
much more secure than they could be otherwise, and
will supply valuable contributions to the educational
world.</p>

<h3><i>SUMMER SCHOOLS AS ACCESSORY TO THE WORK
OF TRAINING.</i></h3>

<p>Among the most distinctively American educational
institutions are Summer Schools for Teachers.
They are meetings organized during the long
summer vacations by private individuals, or in
connection with some University Normal or Training
School, for the help and stimulation of teachers
who have otherwise no opportunity for training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The exact character of the work of a school is
dependent entirely upon the educational aims and
methods of the principal of the school, and the
purpose for which teachers give up three or four
weeks of their holiday to attend a Summer School
may be different in different cases. The teachers of
country schools, inadequately prepared for their
work of teaching, often attend the Summer School in
their county, in order to gain a State training certificate
of a higher grade than that which they already
possess; while teachers in city schools, most of
whom have been trained in Normal Schools, attend
a Summer School like that of Colonel Parker, at
Englewood, to get stimulation for future work, and
to pursue, in addition, a systematic study of pedagogy.
Graduates, who are teaching in schools and
academies during the year, often attend a Summer
School in connection with an University, in order to
pursue further study in various branches. The
Summer Schools I visited at Benton Harbour,
Englewood, Chautauqua, and the Summer School of
Cornell University, illustrate the different lines of
work mentioned.</p>

<p>At Benton Harbour, a small town on the shores
of Lake Michigan, a Summer School was held for
four weeks, and was attended by about fifty teachers
of the rural districts of Michigan, who came to
prepare for a third-grade Teachers’ Certificate of the
State of Michigan. Lessons were given in ordinary
school subjects, pedagogy and drill from half-past
seven in the morning until three or four o’clock in
the afternoon. I spent three or four days at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
school, heard daily lessons in psychology, physical
culture, civil government, English, elocution, and
other subjects, and saw the working of the school
generally. The teaching in all subjects was very
elementary, as little previous knowledge could be
assumed.</p>

<p>Daily work began with exercises in which the
whole school took part. The singing of a hymn
afforded an opportunity for a singing lesson being
given to the whole school, the principal acting as
instructor. Then came the reading of Holy Scripture,
or of selections from literature, and a short
discourse by the principal, after which students
were called upon to give quotations from the works
of famous men and women, or to recite short poems
which had been previously prepared. At the end of
these public exercises, the students were required to
dismiss according to word of command, to turn,
march to music, and to drill as a class of children
would have been required to do. This was intended
to teach the students how to dismiss and drill a
school or class.</p>

<p>Lessons in psychology were given by the principal.
The treatment of the subject was necessarily
very elementary, and, indeed, superficial. I noticed
that the teacher constantly digressed on practical
points, and seemed to know exactly when digression
would be of advantage to his pupils.</p>

<p>Daily lessons on “Experiments” were also given.
These were talks on some of the most elementary
principles of science, and easy experiments showing
how such principles might be illustrated in class.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Capillary attraction was illustrated in a lesson I
heard, and its bearing on everyday life was shown.
Pupils were required to come out of their seats, and
to arrange simple apparatus before the class. As
they were quite unaccustomed to manipulate even
the simplest materials, they seemed to find considerable
difficulty even in drawing out glass tubing and
clamping together glass plates.</p>

<p>The feature of the school, perhaps, the most interesting,
was the anxiety shown by these rural teachers
to lose no opportunity for improvement, and the
keenness with which they followed their daily
lessons. Some of them were so untrained as to find
great difficulty in following the word of command
during drill, but these, who were painfully conscious
of their defects, made rapid progress even in a
week’s time. Summer Schools like that of Benton
Harbour may give real help to the ill-prepared and
untrained country teachers, in increasing their
knowledge, and widening their interests. They
offer advantages to those who have no opportunity
for training, but their conditions are such as to
prevent their becoming an adequate substitute for
it. Indeed, their very existence acknowledges the
fact that country teachers have no opportunities for
preparation, and in itself sanctions a certain amount
of superficiality.</p>

<p>The principal object of Colonel Parker’s Summer
School, held in previous years at Chautauqua, New
York, but this year at Englewood, Chicago, is to
stimulate teachers of all kinds, and to suggest lines
of work to be developed by them during the year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Attracted by the name and work of Colonel Parker,
more than 200 teachers, superintendents of schools,
and persons interested in education, came from
nearly all the States of the Union to attend the
Summer School at Englewood. Most of the ordinary
school staff of the Cook County Normal School at
Englewood acted as teachers in the Summer School,
and Colonel Parker himself gave daily lectures in
psychology. Daily lessons were also given in the
teaching of science, language, and reading, “number”
or arithmetic, music, drawing, and also in
voice culture, Sloyd, physical culture, blackboard
drawing, and other subjects advantageous to the
teacher. The methods of teaching taught in the
Normal School at Englewood were explained and
exemplified in the Summer School, and Kindergarten
and primary classes attached to the Normal School
were taught during the weeks in which the Summer
School was held, in order to show the practical
application of the methods discussed. The students
selected their courses of study. All, however, were
expected to attend the psychology lectures. The
classes in methods of teaching science, methods of
laboratory work, methods of teaching language and
reading, and methods of teaching “number” or
arithmetic, were the most largely attended. Very
keen interest was also taken in the blackboard
drawing.</p>

<p>The work in methods of science was carried on
by lectures, laboratory work by students, and field
work. An important feature of the science lectures
was the attention paid to methods of meteorological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
observation. Blank charts, to show the daily range
and variation of temperature and air-pressure, were
filled in by the students; United States Weather
Bureau maps were studied; the origin and course
of storms in the United States were followed. The
relation of science to other subjects, number, reading,
modelling, painting, drawing, writing, language,
was brought out in the lectures, all the instruction
being such as to suggest methods of actually dealing
with the subjects before a class of children. The
laboratory work was especially suggestive. The
Summer School pupils did individual experimental
work, and had the same instruction and treatment
as a class of children would have had. The practical
science course for the Summer School was:</p>

<p>Field excursions were made weekly, and methods of
conducting children’s field excursions were suggested
and discussed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>The instruction in blackboard drawing, as illustrating
geographical forms, was excellent. In all
cases, the students worked on paper with charcoal, at
the same time as the teacher drew on the wall slate.
After making a sketch, the teacher erased her work
at once, in order to secure rapidity in those who
were copying. The members of the class then distributed
themselves round the room at various parts
of the wall slate, and were required to reproduce
on the wall slate the drawing they had just made,
the teacher meanwhile giving individual help and
criticising. The subjects for blackboard drawing for
the fifteen lessons of the course were:</p>

</div>
<p>Through the kind permission of Colonel Parker, I
was able to hear all lessons and to see the entire
working of the school. Daily visits for nearly a
fortnight served to show, that much educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
life was centered there, and that teachers who
occupied responsible positions in all parts of the
States were receiving new light and stimulation for
the working out of their own particular problems.</p>

<p>At the college of the well-known summer assembly
at Chautauqua, New York, there was no professional
instruction for teachers this year. I heard
some excellent teaching in physics, German and
French; but beyond the fact that many of the
Chautauqua college students were teachers taking
holiday courses of study to equip themselves better
for future teaching, the work that I saw here had no
direct bearing upon the training of teachers.</p>

<p>At Cornell University, courses in pedagogy are
usually given in connection with the summer course
in philosophy. These are for graduate students
only. Psychology lectures, with experimental demonstrations,
are given every day in the week;
lectures on psychological and psychophysical
method, with demonstrations and laboratory practice,
are delivered three times a week; pedagogy and the
history of education are studied by means of
lectures and conferences; methods of teaching the
special subject of study are discussed in connection
with the other summer courses for graduates at
Cornell University. I was present at a very interesting
meeting of teachers who were attending a
summer course in English. Individual members of
the class gave their own experience as regards the
teaching of English and literature in the schools.
The students were mostly specialists in English, and
teachers in private academies, or High Schools, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
an informal discussion of special difficulties and
methods which had been actually tried was very
interesting and helpful to the class as a whole.</p>

<p>A general survey of Summer Schools of all kinds
seems to show that their work cannot be regarded
as that of “Training,” but rather as accessory to it.
Where the principal or conductor of the Summer
School is a man of enthusiasm and enlightenment,
teachers can be refreshed and stimulated in many
ways, by a summer course of work; but to regard a
course as training which supplies no practice-work,
and exists under highly artificial conditions, for a
few weeks only, is to overlook some of the most
important features of training.</p>

<p>As a general summary of the work of Training,
seen in Normal Schools, City Training Schools and
University Departments, it may be stated:</p>

<p>(i.) That the State Normal Schools, adhering to
old traditions, and failing to insist on adequate and
thorough scholarship as an entrance qualification,
have been obliged to devote themselves, either to
securing that scholarship, or to the pursuance of so-called
training under conditions the most conducive
to mechanical lines of work, and dead forms of
method.</p>

<p>(ii.) That the City Training Schools, being entirely
local institutions, supported by local funds,
and only supplying teachers to the schools of the
vicinity, are in danger of being cramped in their
methods by seeking to win public favour.</p>

<p>(iii.) That the University Departments of Pedagogy,
especially those belonging to State Universities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
are capable of affording the widest and best
opportunities for the thorough training of primary
and secondary teachers, and in supplying these
opportunities, they will not only help forward the
cause in which they are immediately engaged, but
afford a valuable means of unifying and stimulating
education generally.</p>

<p>The existence of the good and the bad side by
side is as marked a feature in training institutions
as in any other department of American education,
and suggests great rapidity of progress in some
directions. Where the training is bad, old methods
have been retained under new conditions; and where
good results have been obtained, they are due to the
readiness to try new methods, and to keep in touch
with the educational progress of the day. The
stimulus to much that is good in the present training
of teachers in America is the psychological
study of children, which now is being systematically
organized in a “National Association for the
Study of Children.” Not only scientific workers,
but teachers and parents throughout the country,
are beginning to realize the important bearing of
child-study upon all educational questions, and nowhere
is their enthusiasm for matters educational
more shown than in their united devotion to the
solution of this new problem.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART II.<br>

<small><span class="smcap">By Millicent Hughes.</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN America, as in Europe, it is becoming increasingly
recognised, that the fact of having
received a good education, even if that education
have included a University course, is no guarantee
of fitness for the teaching profession. That some
special professional preparation is also necessary before
a teacher can be safely entrusted with teaching
responsibility can hardly be said to be any longer a
matter of debate among those who have devoted
time and thought to educational questions. There
may be much difference of opinion as to the best way
of giving that preparation, but that it should be given
is becoming more and more a foregone conclusion.
There seems at last some chance that a well-earned
rest may be allowed to the well-worn comparison
made between the doctor’s and teacher’s professions,
with its obvious moral—that just as no right-thinking
parent would allow an unqualified practitioner
to prescribe for his child’s body, so it should
be impossible for that far less understood and
delicate something, which we call the mind, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
entrusted to the care of one whose only qualification
for the post is the possession of a certain amount of
useful information. There are many battles yet to
be fought, many experiments yet to be tried, many
failures yet to be faced, ere all shall be agreed on
the best kind of professional training that can be
given to teachers; yet I have returned from
America encouraged in the belief that the decisive
battle in favour of training has been fought and
won on both sides of the Atlantic, and that the
old world and the new may with advantage to both
join hands in the endeavour to discover the best
ways and means of such training.</p>

<p>And it would seem especially fitting that England
and America should thus join hands, for, after all,
few things about the Americans impressed me more
than the fact that they are really English, and that
the inhabitants of Great Britain and the United
States really form part of one great English-speaking
nation, with the heritage of a noble language
and literature, and a common life of thought and
feeling. In matters educational, the truth of this
oneness impressed me vividly. Allowing for such
differences as must exist between an old and a new
country, it is nevertheless true that most of the
problems in education which they are trying to
solve are those which perplex us also, and of these
the problem of the Training of Teachers holds a
place in the front rank. But it is a curious and
interesting fact, that the solution should be attempted
in both countries, and yet that so little
attention should be paid in each to what is being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
done in the other. The ignorance that prevails
among American teachers as to what is being
attempted in England is, I fear, only equalled by
our own ignorance of American educational life.
This ignorance is largely the result of the difficulty
that both American and English teachers experience,
in obtaining definite information on educational
matters in connection with either country. This
fact made it very difficult for me even to map out
my tour, so as to include as far as possible what
was typical of American Training in the short time
at my disposal, and had it not been for the unvarying
kindness and courtesy shown me by American
teachers, in directing my notice to what was best
worth seeing, my task would have presented almost
insuperable difficulties. As it is, I have, of course,
been unable to cover the whole ground, and indeed
have been able to personally examine into the opportunities
for training in a very few States. These,
however, I believe to be representative States, from
a study of the means of training in which it is
possible to arrive at a very fair conclusion of its
condition in the States as a whole. They include
the following: Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, New York, Michigan and
Illinois. I was, however, fortunate in being able
to supplement the information thus obtained by a
careful study of the many excellent State exhibits
in the Educational Department of the Liberal Arts
Building, at the World’s Fair, and to further correct
and intensify the impressions I had received by
many conversations with educationists from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
parts of the United States, whom it was my good
fortune to meet at the Educational Congresses, held
at Chicago in July.</p>

<p>In considering any American educational question,
there are one or two points which must never be
lost sight of, and perhaps it will be well to indicate
them here. In the first place, it must be remembered
that there is not one American educational system,
but many. Each State has complete control of its
own educational matters, has its own School Law,
sets aside common lands, or levies taxes for the
support of its own schools, and is responsible to no
higher authority. The only part taken by the
Central Government of the United States in connection
with education has been in the establishment
of a Bureau of Education, the chief functions of
which have been (1) the collecting of statistics and
general information respecting education in all the
various States, which are embodied in an annual
report made by the Commissioner of Education,
(2) the publishing of monographs and circulars of
information on topics of educational interest, such
as Co-education, Teaching of History, etc., and (3)
the maintaining of a valuable Pedagogical Reference
Library at Washington.</p>

<p>Secondly, a distinction must be made between
the Western States, of which Michigan might
be taken as representative, and the Eastern, of
which Massachusetts might be considered typical.
In the former we find a most complete system of
State education, leading from the Primary School
right up to the great co-educational University of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Michigan. The State Schools there have few
private rivals, and the University none. In the
State of Massachusetts, on the contrary, although
Primary, Grammar and High Schools are maintained
at the public expense, yet the children of a large
proportion of the inhabitants attend private schools
and academies, which undertake to prepare them
for Harvard or the Women’s Colleges, such as
Wellesley. In fact, few of those who enter upon a
University career do so straight from the common
school, as is the case in the Western States. It
follows from this that there are two classes of
teachers to be considered in the Eastern States—(1)
those who teach in the common schools (Primary,
Grammar and High), and (2) those who teach
in private schools and in the academies. Those of
the second class are largely recruited from the
ranks of College graduates, who rely upon their
University course as preparation for the profession
of teaching, and amongst whom the idea of a special
training for their work has only here and there been
awakened. It is mainly in connection with State
education that the idea of the training of teachers
has been developed, although the fact that several
of the older Universities, including Harvard, are
providing courses of lectures on the Science and
Art of Teaching may be taken as a hopeful sign of
the gradual growth of the idea among all classes of
teachers.</p>

<p>It will be perhaps well to enumerate the various
means available for the Training of Teachers in the
United States, and then to describe more particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the special features of the training to be
obtained in each kind of institution.</p>

<h3><i>NORMAL SCHOOLS.</i></h3>

<p>There are three kinds of Normal Schools to be
considered—State, City and Private. It was my
privilege to visit a good number belonging to the
first two classes, but I was not fortunate enough to
be able to inspect any of the Private Normal
Schools. These latter are, of course, chiefly to be
found in those States which have few or no State
or City Normal Schools.</p>

<p>The difference between State and City Normal
Schools is mainly one of control. The State Normal
School forms part of the State Common School
system, and is under the direct supervision of the
State Superintendent and Board of Education, while
the City Normal School belongs to the City School
system, and is under the jurisdiction of the City
Superintendent. The State Normal School is intended
to provide teachers for the schools in any
part of the State, while the City Normal School has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
for its object the preparation of teachers for the
City schools alone.</p>

<p>At present one of the most hotly debated questions
in connection with Normal Schools relates to the
subjects to be included in the curriculum. Shall
the Normal School give professional training alone,
or shall it also provide instruction in Academic
subjects? There is at present much divergence of
opinion on the subject, and some schools are
organized on the one principle, and some on the
other.</p>

<p>At present some of the Normal Schools have a
double function to perform, that of serving as High
Schools, and at the same time as professional Training
Colleges. There is, however, a growing feeling
against this plan, and a tendency, wherever possible,
to separate those who intend to become teachers
from those who do not. But many Normal Schools,
while claiming to be only professional, yet include
Academic subjects in their curricula. Two reasons
for this are commonly urged. In the first place, it
is said that it is impossible to get a large enough
supply of candidates for training who are sufficiently
well equipped for their profession from the point of
view of mere information; and secondly, that even
those who have the necessary information have
acquired it in such a way that it is almost useless
for teaching purposes. For such, a complete revision
of the various subjects, taken in conjunction
with a consideration of the best methods of teaching
the same, is regarded as necessary; it being maintained
by those in favour of this plan that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
almost impossible to get instruction in the various
subjects that will be of any value to them as
teachers, outside a Normal School.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some who maintain
that the Normal School should be strictly professional,
admitting none to its courses but those who
can give evidence of having had ample academic
preparation. Many, however, who believe that the
courses in academic studies are at present necessary
yet look forward to the time when they will be no
longer required.</p>

<p>There appears to be a growing feeling in the
States in favour of the complete separation of the
professional from the academic course, and it is
interesting to note that the question is agitating
the minds of those who have to do with the training
of teachers in America, at the same time that it
has become a burning question in England in
connection with the training of our Elementary
Teachers. The Normal Schools correspond
more or less closely with our English Elementary
Training Colleges, and an examination of their
points of likeness and difference may not prove
unprofitable.</p>

<p>In the first place, it should be noted, that the
absence of any uniform standard of attainment,
such as is more or less secured in England by the
fact that there is one government examination for
all Colleges, makes it possible for there to be a
great difference in the rank held by different Normal
Schools. As each school fixes its own standard
of graduation, and the conditions for admission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
length of course and final tests vary with each institution,
it comes about that much depends upon
the Normal School, of which a given teacher is a
graduate.</p>

<p>Some Normal Schools, for instance, have a course
extending over four years, in others it only lasts
from one to two years, while some offer a choice of
courses of varying length. In England, on the
contrary, the Elementary Training course is uniformly
two years in all Colleges, the length being
only occasionally varied in the cases of individuals,
as when, on special recommendation, a third year is
allowed, or a candidate who has already obtained a
certificate is admitted to a Training College for one
year’s training.</p>

<p>This lack of uniformity in the length of course in
American Normal Schools is largely the result of
the absence of any <i>one</i> standard of admission.
While in England there is one examination, the
Queen’s Scholarship, which must be passed by all,
except University graduates who desire to enter
an Elementary College, in America the conditions
vary with each individual Normal School. Some
require at least a certificate of graduation from a
High School, some have an entrance examination
of their own, which none may be excused, while
others offer one to those who have no certificates to
show.</p>

<p>Some Normal Schools are regarded as affording
suitable preparation for the Universities, and are
attended by those who hope to take up a University
course later on, while others grant degrees of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
own, or arrange special courses for those who have
taken degrees elsewhere.</p>

<p>The fact that there are so many differences in
respect of length of course and choice of subjects,
between the Normal Schools of various States and
Cities, makes it exceedingly difficult to form any
accurate generalizations. It will probably, therefore,
be wiser at this point to give a more detailed
account of the Normal Schools which I had an
opportunity of studying in the above-mentioned
States.</p>

<h3><i>PENNSYLVANIA.</i></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania has eleven State Normal Schools,
the two most important of which I was able to visit.
The Normal School Law for this State provides for
two courses of study; the Elementary Course and
the Scientific Course. The first of these leads to
the certificate Bachelor of the Element (B.E.), while
the diploma of the second constitutes its holder
Bachelor of the Sciences (B.S.).</p>

<p>The outlines of these courses are laid down by the
State as follows, but each Normal School can adapt
them as seems best. Most Normal Schools also
arrange for a Preparatory Course.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

</div>

<p>To graduate at a Pennsylvanian State Normal
School, students must attend at least twenty-one
weeks. The Faculty first examines the candidates
in all the branches of study; if they find them qualified
they recommend them to the State Board of
Examiners, and certify that they have completed
the course of study as required by law, and have
taught the required time in the Model School.</p>

<p>The final examinations are conducted by a State
Board of Examiners, who are appointed by the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction, from the
following classes:—the State Superintendent or
Deputy Superintendent, who is President of the
Board, the Principal of another Normal School, two
County or Borough Superintendents from the First
District, and the Principal of this Normal School.
Each student must receive four votes out of the five
in order to pass the examination, and to graduate.</p>

<p>The final examination occurs about two weeks
before Commencement,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the date being fixed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
State Superintendent. The examination is almost
wholly in writing, and lasts two or three days.</p>

<p>Regular graduates who have continued their
studies for two years (<i>i.e.</i> have completed either the
Elementary or Scientific Course), and have practised
their profession for two years in the Common Schools
of the State, and who have presented to the Faculty
and Board of Examiners a certificate of good moral
character and skill in the Art of Teaching from the
Board or Boards of Directors by whom they were
employed, countersigned by the proper County
Superintendent, receive further diplomas, constituting
them Masters in the Course in which they
graduated, and conferring upon them one of the
following degrees: Master of the Elements (M.E.);
Master of the Sciences (M.S.).</p>

<p>These diplomas confer upon their holders the right
to teach the subjects therein named, in the public
schools of Pennsylvania, without further examination.</p>

<p>It is also the duty of the Pennsylvania Normal
Schools to grant State certificates to such teachers
in the Common Schools of the State who make
application for the same, and who fulfil the following
conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. Each applicant must be twenty-one years of
age, and must have taught in the Common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Schools of the State during three successive
years.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. Each must present certificates of moral character,
and skill in practical teaching.</p>

<p>iii. The examination must be either in the subjects
of the Elementary or Scientific
Course, and must be taken at the time of
the Annual Examination of the Normal
School at which application is made.</p>

<p>&#160;iv. Each applicant is required to present an
original Thesis on some educational subject.</p>
</div>

<p>The School year is usually forty-two weeks, and
is divided into two sessions—a winter session of
about twenty-eight weeks from August to March,
and a summer of fourteen weeks, beginning with the
end of March.</p>

<p>The usual charge for the Winter Session is $140
(about £28), and for the Summer Session $70 (about
£14).</p>

<p>By a recent Act of the Legislature the following
appropriations are made by the State to Normal
students and graduates.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160;&#160;i. Each student over seventeen years of age who
shall sign a paper declaring his intention
to teach in the Common Schools of the
State shall receive the sum of fifty cents
(about 2<i>s.</i>) per week toward defraying the
expenses of tuition and boarding.</p>

<p>&#160;ii. Each student who upon graduating shall sign
an agreement to teach in the Common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Schools of the State two full school years
shall receive the sum of fifty dollars (about
£10).</p>

<p>iii. Any student desiring to secure the benefits
must attend the School at least twelve
consecutive weeks, and must join a class
in Methods of Instruction or School Management.
These benefits will be deducted
from the regular expenses of board and
tuition.</p>
</div>

<p>About four miles from Lancaster, and connected
with it by an electric railway, is the little village
of Millersville, where is located the oldest Normal
School of the State. It was established in 1855, and
recognised as the First State Normal School in Pennsylvania
in 1859. It is a co-educational school with
accommodation for about 500 students, although permission
is also sometimes given to students to board
out. The buildings are typical of this kind of Normal
School. There is a central building containing the
Chapel, recitation<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and dining-rooms, etc., while on
either side are two dormitories, one for the men students,
and one for the women. There is also a
gymnasium; and two handsome buildings—a Library,
and a Science building with lecture rooms and laboratories—are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
in process of erection. There are more
women students than men, and fewer of the latter
intend to become teachers in the State; often they
only use the Normal School as a stepping-stone to
the University.</p>

<p>An excellent Model School, comprising a Kindergarten
and eight grades, is attached to the Institution,
in which the students observe the methods used
by the critic teachers in various subjects, and also
teach under supervision. I heard one of the critic
teachers give a model lesson on a brook basin, and
afterwards deliver a lecture to the students on the
teaching of Geography, in which the special points
of teaching method in connection with the brook
basin, school district and township were dwelt upon
and discussed. I had, moreover, the opportunity of
hearing one of the students teach, and was also fortunate
enough to be able to listen to a reading lesson
given by the head of the Model School on the sentence
method.</p>

<p>I next visited the Normal School at West Chester,
which was started in 1871. Its buildings are on much
the same plan as those at Millersville, with the two
wings for men and women students, and the dining
and recitation rooms in the centre. The Principal,
with pardonable pride, drew my special attention to
the gymnasium building, which, with the single exception
of the new Yale Gymnasium, is believed to
be the most complete connected with any school or
college in the States. It contains a full supply of
the best apparatus, running tracks, bath-rooms, large
swimming-pool, bowling alleys, ball cage, etc. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
thoroughly trained physician<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and his wife are in
charge of the gymnasium, and all exercise is taken
under their supervision. I was able to attend several
of the classes—one on School Method, which took
the form of a discussion of such points as the following:
“What degree of quiet is necessary in a
school?” “On what does ability to govern depend?”
“Can ability to govern be acquired?” I
was much struck here, as in other American schools
and colleges, with the ease in speaking, and the
keen interest shown by the students in taking part
in the discussion. A lesson in Arithmetic, in which
the students made excellent use of that distinctive
feature of an American recitation room—the continuous
blackboard, one on United States history, and
a lesson on physiology given in the Model School,
helped to fill up a most interesting morning.</p>

<h3><i>CONNECTICUT.</i></h3>

<p>There are two State Normal Schools in the State
of Connecticut—one at New Britain, started in 1850,
and the other at Willimantic, opened in 1889. These
schools have for their object the definite preparation
of teachers for work in the State schools, and no
encouragement is given to other students to enter.
They thus differ from the Pennsylvania Normal
Schools, which are often attended by those who do
not intend to become teachers. This difference
appears to produce one curious and instructive result—namely,
that while a large number of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
students are to be found in the Pennsylvania Normal
Schools, they are conspicuous by their absence from
those in Connecticut. This is easily understood when
one remembers that an overwhelming majority of
the teachers in the Common Schools are women,
and that as few men intend to take up teaching as
a permanent profession, they are not likely to be
found in those Normal Schools, the courses of which
will not serve as stepping-stones to a future college
or other career.</p>

<p>Neither of these two Schools are residential, but
the Principals undertake to assist students in finding
comfortable accommodation. Board and lodging
can usually be obtained from $3 to $4 (14<i>s.</i> to 17<i>s.</i>)
per week.</p>

<p>Candidates for admission must either (1) pass an
entrance examination held at certain centres in the
State, or (2) present a certificate of graduation from
a High School or State Teachers’ Certificate, or (3)
have taught successfully for three years.</p>

<p>The course is arranged for two years, but no
student can graduate from the schools unless considered
fit to teach by the Faculty. They may
either remain longer as students, or if thought to be
hopeless may be requested to withdraw.</p>

<p>At both schools there are at least two parts to the
course: (1) that done in the Normal School, including
the Theory of Education, and special work
in science and other subjects; and (2) that done in
the Model or Training Schools. Each School has also
a Kindergarten, and at New Britain there is a special
course for the training of Kindergarten teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Students who attain the required standard of
scholarship in every prescribed subject, and exhibit
a fair degree of skill in teaching and governing
children, <i>and</i> pass the State Examination for
Teachers, receive a Diploma of Graduation.</p>

<p>The fitness of any teacher for her profession is
thus determined partly by the authorities of the
Normal School, and partly by the State.</p>

<p>All necessary text-books are free, but students are
encouraged to purchase a few books of reference.</p>

<p>The aim of this school is entirely professional, but
it is found so difficult to obtain a supply of sufficiently
prepared students that some academic work,
especially in science, is found to be necessary, and
each student is expected to learn to make certain
sets of apparatus, which will be afterwards helpful
in the teaching of science in the schools. The
Principal informed me that he considered that the
school was stronger on the practical than on the
theoretical side. Most certainly the practical training
of teachers is most thoroughly arranged for. A
Model School of 500 children is attached to the
school, the classes in which are in the hands of
trained and enthusiastic teachers, who are constantly
endeavouring to improve existing and devise new
methods of teaching. In reading, for instance, the
children make their own reading lesson, the subjects
being taken from lessons on elementary science, literature,
etc., which they have had. With the help of
the blackboard, simple sentences, giving an account of
the lesson or its story, are collected, and then printed
by the school printing press, which proves an invaluable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
addition to the school apparatus. Drawing
is also taught almost entirely in connection with
other school subjects, the illustrating of Science,
History and Geography lessons being thus utilized.</p>

<p>During the training course, the students give a
few lessons in the Model School, and spend a good
deal of time in observation. But a comparatively
new and important feature in connection with the
practical training is the six months which students
are encouraged to spend after graduation at a Practice
School which has been opened at South Manchester.
Here the graduates teach under supervision,
and obtain that amount of practice under favourable
circumstances which is so necessary to the perfecting
of the teacher.</p>

<p>At Willimantic, as at New Britain, especial stress is
laid on preparing the teacher for the practical part
of the profession. The child, however, is the unit of
the school, and on the right understanding of the
child depends the teacher’s success in teaching. The
child has both a body and a mind to be trained, and
the two cannot be separated. It is therefore necessary
that a teacher should know something about
each, and students are therefore expected to devote
a good deal of time to the study of Physiology in
the Junior year, and to the study of Psychology in
the Senior.</p>

<p>The Model Schools<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> are most carefully staffed,
and the students spend as much time as possible in
observing work done in these schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>During the last term of the course, each student
serves as an assistant in the various grades of the
Model Schools, thus having experience in teaching
under the guidance and criticism of an expert in
each grade.</p>

<p>The course is for two years, but the Principal is
anxious to have the time extended.</p>

<h3><i>NEW YORK STATE.</i></h3>

<p>The first Normal School for the State of New
York was opened at Albany in 1844. There are
now eleven such schools in the State, two of which—Albany
and Oswego—are entirely professional,
while the others provide also for academic work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The following extracts from the circular issued
by the Superintendent of Public Instruction give
the principal features common to all the Normal
Schools of the State of New York.</p>

<p>“Students will be appointed to the Normal Schools
by the Superintendent, upon the recommendation of
superintendents and school commissioners. These
officers will be relied upon to properly represent to
possible candidates the needs of the public schools
for well-qualified teachers, and the necessity of professional
and technical training on the part of all
who intend to teach. No students can be admitted
who have not already acquired a substantial elementary
education. This can be gained in all of the
ordinary schools, and the professional training
schools cannot be properly taxed with work which
the common schools can perform as well. Through
the quality of the work performed, through the
attainments and the professional spirit and purpose
of graduates, rather than through mere multiplicity
of numbers, can the Normal Schools best promote
the educational interests of the State. There is room
and welcome in the Normal Schools for the graduates
of the elementary and secondary schools, and even
for those who have made substantial advancement
in the elementary course without technical graduation,
provided that they give promise of becoming
successful teachers, and possess the desire to become
such; but there is no room for students who have
laid no real foundation for professional training, and
who have no well-determined purpose about the
matter and no fair conception of the responsibilities
and obligations of a teacher’s occupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Appointments will ordinarily follow recommendations,
but students will be admitted or retained in
Normal Schools only when they show scholarship
and other qualities in justification of the appointment.</p>

<p>“The following form of recommendation will be
used, and will be supplied from the department or
from any of the schools upon application. When
filled out it should be mailed to the Superintendent,
and when approved it will be by him sent direct to
the school. No student can be appointed who is not
fully sixteen years of age.</p>

State Certificates or Commissioner’s Certificates,
granted under the uniform examination system,
and still in force, showing a standing of seventy-five
per cent. in arithmetic, grammar and geography,

persons as specially desire to do so, and who comply
with the requirements as to admission, may be admitted
upon paying to the treasurer of the Local
Board a tuition fee of twenty dollars per term of
twenty weeks in advance. No mileage fees<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> will be

<p>“Tuition and the use of all text-books are free.
Students will be held responsible, however, for any
injury or loss of books. They are advised to bring

refunded to those who remain a full term.</p>

<p>“A year is divided into two terms of twenty weeks
each. The Autumn term commences on the first
Wednesday in September, and the Spring term on
the second Wednesday in February. There will be
an intermission for a week during the holidays.”</p>

<p>There are three courses of study which can be
followed: an English course arranged for three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
years, a Classical and a Scientific arranged for four
years. (Albany and Oswego have specially arranged
courses.)</p>

<p>Students who satisfactorily complete any one of
the above courses receive diplomas, which serve as
licenses to teach in the public schools of the State.</p>

<p>The first Normal School of the State was located
at Albany. Until 1890 it had, like most of the other
schools, academic as well as professional work, but
it was then reorganized on a new plan, under the
title of “New York State Normal College.” This
College now devotes itself entirely to the giving of
instruction in the Science and Art of Teaching.</p>

<p>The courses of study are as follows:—</p>

<p>1. <i>English Course</i>, which extends over two years,
and embraces Psychology, History and Philosophy
of Education, Methods of teaching all ordinary school
subjects, School Economy and School Law, Kindergarten
methods and practice in teaching under
criticism. Graduates from this course receive a life
diploma or license to teach.</p>

<p>2. <i>Classical Course.</i> This is also a two years’
course on much the same lines as the English, but
with the addition of Methods of teaching Latin and
Greek, or German, or French. A much severer
entrance examination must, however, be passed to
gain admission to this course than is required for
the English. A life diploma and the degree of
Bachelor of Pedagogy are conferred on graduates
from this course.</p>

<p>3. <i>Supplementary Course.</i> This takes one year,
which is devoted to the reading of leading educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
authors, the discussion of educational subjects,
and the preparation of an original thesis. Those who
take this course in addition to the English receive
the degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy, and those who
take it in addition to the Classical receive that of
Master of Pedagogy.</p>

<p>4. <i>One year Course for graduates</i> from Colleges and
Universities in which they are allowed to select a
course (approved by the Faculty) for one year, and
can receive a life diploma and the degree of Bachelor
of Pedagogy.</p>

<p>5. <i>Kindergartner’s Course.</i></p>

<p>I unfortunately reached Albany too late to see the
school in working order, but from what its Principal,
Dr. Milne, told me, it appears to possess the most
purely professional course of any Normal School in
the States.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Oswego.</span></h4>

<p>The Oswego School was first organized as a City
Training School in 1861, but was adopted as a State
School in 1863. The history of this school is the
history of its Principal, Dr. Sheldon. When quite
young, he became interested in the question of the
education of the poor of his native city, Oswego.
With the help of friends the first free school was
started, but as no teacher could be found, he had to
teach himself. He was able, in 1853, to organize a
city system of schools, and became superintendent.
Dissatisfaction with the teaching results of his schools
led him to consider the question of methods. On a
visit to Toronto, he saw in the National Museum a
collection of educational appliances used abroad, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
especially at the Home and Colonial Training School
in London. He brought back all the apparatus that
he could, but both he and his teachers realized the
need of training, and finally some of them resigned
half their salaries for one year, in order that a training
teacher might be brought over from the Home
and Colonial Training College. Miss M. E. M. Jones,
an ardent disciple of Pestalozzi, came in response to
their request, and day by day, after school hours,
she met this enthusiastic little band of teachers,
which was the first Training Class. After she left,
those she had taught were able to carry it on, and
the training of teachers was an established fact in
Oswego. The course was at first only for one year,
but was later extended to three and four when the
school was taken over by the State.</p>

<p>With the consent of the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, the classical department has
been dropped out of the Oswego School, and more
extended lines of English work have been taken up
as elective courses. The regular English course is
taken for three years, and one of these for the fourth.</p>

<p>This course includes advanced work in science,
history, higher English, psychology, pedagogy,
drawing, and teaching under criticism, and occupies
two terms of twenty weeks each.</p>

<p>Those who show marked talent for primary and
kindergarten work may, after graduation, be invited
by a vote of the Faculty to take an additional
year in special training for kindergarten and
primary teachers. At the end of this course diplomas
are granted, indicating fitness to take charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of kindergartens; and in addition, certificates of
special qualifications for primary work are given,
signed by all the members of the Faculty.</p>

<p>In order to meet the increasing demand for
teachers who can undertake training work in Normal
Schools, a special course has been started, which
lasts for five months, and includes lectures in psychology,
pedagogy, kindergarten principles and
methods; observation of the work in the kindergarten;
attendance upon the criticisms of the
critics in all the departments of the training work;
making out criticisms on the work in the different
departments of the school of practice and actual
teaching under criticism; making out time-tables
for the different grades of schools; observation of
work in the school of practice as done by practice
teachers, to gain an idea of arrangement, distribution
and grading of subject matter; observation of
special lessons, followed by criticisms of same. A
course of professional reading is prescribed, as well
as the preparation of papers on various topics connected
with method and criticism. Occasional
opportunities are provided, to put into practice
ideal and experimental lines of work, by teaching
classes; and instruction is given in making apparatus,
charts, etc., to illustrate the subjects taught in the
common schools.</p>

<p>Teachers for this course are also selected by the
Faculty, on the ground of their superior moral,
intellectual, physical and professional qualifications,
and of special fitness for the work; and on the
satisfactory completion of the same, receive certificates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
signed by all the members of the Faculty,
indicating their fitness to act as critics and teachers
of methods in Normal and Training Schools.</p>

<p>Experience in teaching in the various grades of
the public schools is considered important before
entering upon this work.</p>

<p>It is not in a strict sense a residential college, but
students from a distance are expected to live in a
boarding-house attached to the school.</p>

<p>Great stress is laid upon the elaboration of
methods of teaching of various subjects, and from
the Oswego School have come many improvements
in ways of teaching. Perhaps the chief contribution
to methodology is that known as the “laboratory”
method of teaching history, which is said to have
revolutionized the teaching of history in American
Schools. It is an adaptation of the seminary
method introduced by the German historian Ranke.
In order to make this method possible in the schools,
specially prepared text-books were needed, and
these Dr. Sheldon’s daughter undertook to write.
Two text-books have been published: <i>Studies in
General History</i>, and <i>Studies in American History</i>,
both of which have been extensively adopted in
American Schools. In these books there is presented
to the pupil a carefully chosen body of
original historical material—typical extracts from
the laws, constitution, creeds and other records of
the past—pictures of monuments, temples, statues
and relics, together with questions upon this
material that test and train the pupil’s powers of
judgment and reason. In connection also with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
teaching of history the plan is advocated, and
carried out in connection with the Model School, of
allowing the children to compile the history of their
own town, collecting the information for themselves,
and recording it in a manuscript book kept for the
purpose, which they can also illustrate by original
drawings of their own. I saw a delightful history
of Oswego compiled in this way, and in several
other towns I found that school children were
undertaking similar work.</p>

<p>Most of the method-teaching is carried on by
means of discussions on topics given. I was able
to attend one of these, and also to see some of the
teaching in the Practice School.</p>

<p>Perhaps what impressed me most about the
school was the large amount of liberty allowed to
the students, and the absence of rules. Dr. Sheldon
told me that the experience of his lifetime had only
confirmed him in the belief, that the fullest freedom
is necessary for the right development of character,
and that year by year he had given his students an
ever-increasing amount of liberty. The idea of
self-government and responsibility is inculcated,
and rare are the cases in which this freedom is
abused.</p>

<h3><i>MASSACHUSETTS.</i></h3>

<p>To Massachusetts belongs the honour of having
led the way in the establishment of Normal Schools.
The Massachusetts Board of Education, established
in 1838, at once took up the question of the training
of teachers for the public schools. A member of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Board, the Hon. Edmund Dwight, of Boston, offered
$10,000 on condition that the Legislature would
appropriate an equal amount towards providing for
such training. His offer was accepted, and three
Normal Schools were opened, each of which was
to continue for three years as an experiment. The
experiments proved completely successful. There
are now six State Normal Schools, which are under
the direct control of the Board of Education, and
supported entirely by the State. Tuition is free to
all who undertake to teach in the State Schools.
The arrangements for boarding vary with each
school.</p>

<p>The State appropriates $4,000 per annum to be
divided among those students of Normal Schools
who stand in need of such aid.</p>

<p>Text-books and reference books are free.</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
“The design of the State Normal Schools is
strictly professional; that is, to prepare in the best
possible manner the pupils for the work of organizing,
governing and teaching the public schools of the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>“To this end there must be the most thorough
knowledge; first, of the branches of learning required
to be taught in the schools; second, of the best
methods of teaching those branches; and third, of
right mental training.</p>

<p>“The time of one course extends through a period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of two years; of the other, through a period of four
years, and is divided into terms of twenty weeks
each, with daily sessions of not less than five hours,
five days each week.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Studies.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Two Years’ Course</i>:</p>

<p>Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, book-keeping.</p>

<p>Physics, astronomy, chemistry, physiology, botany, zoology,
mineralogy, geology, geography.</p>

<p>Language, reading, orthography, etymology, grammar,
rhetoric, literature, composition.</p>

<p>Penmanship, drawing, vocal music, gymnastics.</p>

<p>Psychology, science and art of education, school organization
and history of education.</p>

<p>Civil polity of Massachusetts and of the United States,
history, school laws of Massachusetts.</p>
</div>

<p>In accordance with a vote of the Board of Education,
pupils are encouraged to add a half-year to
this course of study, provided six months of their
entire time be spent mainly in additional practice
and observation.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><i>Four Years’ Course</i>:</p>

<p>In addition to the studies named above, the four years’
course includes advanced algebra and geometry, trigonometry
and surveying.</p>

<p>Advanced chemistry, physics and botany.</p>

<p>Drawing, English literature, general history.</p>

<p>Latin and French required; German and Greek as the
principal, and visitors shall decide.</p>
</div>

<p>This course is intended to give pupils that broad
culture indispensable to the highest success in
schools of any grade, but especially to fit them for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
service as teachers in high schools. The studies are
so arranged that graduates from the shorter course
may complete the four years’ course in two additional
years.</p>

<p>“There are now in the Commonwealth six State
Normal Schools, established for the purpose of training
teachers to teach in the public schools. The
Normal Schools are now well provided with the
means of communicating professional instruction.</p>

<p>“As a knowledge of the principles and method of
teaching seems to be one thing, and skill in the
application of principles quite another, it is necessary
that ample opportunity be given in the training
schools connected with the Normal Schools for
practice in teaching by the normal students as they
study the principles. Such practice, if systematically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and intelligently conducted during the course
of instruction, will prepare the normal graduate
to enter upon the practice of his profession with the
advantages of experience.</p>

<p>“If the standard for admission to the Normal
Schools be raised, as the Board of Education now
contemplates, they will be relieved of a large amount
of academical work now required, and of many
candidates whose limited knowledge and capacity
for acquiring it make them improper subjects for
professional training.</p>

<p>“The time has come when a professional training
should be considered a requisite for teaching in the
public schools of the Commonwealth.”</p>

<p>Framingham, the first State Normal School in the
United States, was first located at Lexington, where
it was opened July 3rd, 1839, with three students.
In 1852 the school was removed to Framingham.
It admits women students only, who reside in the
boarding halls attached to the school.</p>

<p>“The design of the school is to give:</p>

<p>1. “A review of the studies taught in the public
schools.</p>

<p>2. “A careful study of the history of education
and the school law of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>3. “A study of Psychology, for the purpose of
ascertaining true principles and good methods.</p>

<p>4. “A practical application of these principles and
methods in teaching.</p>

<p>5. “A high estimate of the importance and responsibility
of the teacher’s work, and an enthusiasm
for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Westfield.</span></h4>

<p>Another school was opened at Barre, September
4th, 1839, but was moved to Westfield in 1844. It
is intended for both men and women students, but
out of 147 students in 1892 only 7 were men.</p>

<p>There is a Normal Hall of Residence, erected and
furnished by the State, at which either men or
women students can live.</p>

<p>The subjects taken are the same as those in the
other Normal Schools of the State, for the two or
four years’ course. All studies are pursued on the
topical plan, and with special reference to the best
ways of teaching them. Every student frequently
takes charge of a class, and teaches topics, so that
throughout the course he is under actual training
as teacher.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity of hearing a class in
Didactics, conducted by Principal Greenough on the
topical method. I found that “topics” simply
meant the heads or divisions of subjects. The
students had been previously given topics to prepare,
and they were called on two at a time to go
to the blackboard and write up and explain to the
class alternately the various points to be considered
under each head. These points were one by one
discussed with the Principal and other students.
This topical method is adopted at many other
schools and colleges. It often happens that one or
two students only are entrusted with topics to prepare,
which they are expected to be ready to explain
to the rest of the class, subject of course to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
criticism of the teacher and discussion by the
class.</p>

<p>The students obtain the necessary practice in
teaching, partly in the above way by teaching each
other, and partly by giving lessons in the Model
School under the critic teachers. Each student is also
required to teach for four weeks continuously, and
to spend a good deal of time in observing children,
and the work of the teachers in the Model School.</p>

<p>The school is very well provided with apparatus.
Almost every subject taught has its special room
with appropriate appliances for teaching. I was
especially struck by the apparatus for teaching geography.
Large wooden trays lined with zinc, and
placed on supports so as to resemble low tables,
were used for modelling in wet sand. Special
classes were held to instruct the students in the art
of sand-moulding.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Worcester.</span></h4>

<p>Bridgewater Normal School was opened in 1840.
It receives both men and women students, the
number for this year being 272, of which 58 are
men, and 214 women.</p>

<p>There are two Halls of Residence, at which
students may reside.</p>

<p>Four courses are possible: 1. Two years’ course.
2. Three years’ or intermediate course. 3. Four
years’ course, and 4. Post-graduate course for
college graduates.</p>

<p>There appears to be especially good provision for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the teaching of science, the new buildings having
ample laboratory accommodation.</p>

<p>Worcester is the youngest of the Normal Schools,
having been opened in 1874. It is open to both men
and women, but the latter largely preponderate.</p>

<p>In addition to the ordinary two and four year
courses, college graduates are allowed to take up
a special elective course.</p>

<p>This school has certain special features which
distinguish it and require note.</p>

<p>The study of psychology is pursued in part by the
original observation of children. The students are
asked to observe the conduct of children in all circumstances,
and to record what they see and hear
as soon as possible, in a simple and concise manner,
without any comment by the writer. They are
advised to note the usual rather than the unusual
conduct of the children observed. For convenience
of classification, blanks of five colours are used:
white for observations made by the students themselves;
red for those reported by others; yellow for
reminiscences of the student’s own childhood; green
for records made from books, and chocolate for a
continued series of observations made on the same
child. The date, name of observer and post-office
address; the name, sex, nationality and age of child
observed; and also the length of time elapsing
between the making and recording of the observation,
are all set forth on these papers.</p>

<p>The making of these observations is quite voluntary,
but the students become so interested in the
work that an ever-increasing number of reports are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
sent in. Some 16,000 have already been collected.
These are placed at the disposal of the Clark University,
which has from time to time made use of
the material thus brought together. These records
are valuable in themselves, but still more valuable
is the training in observation of children afforded to
the students in making them.</p>

<p>The students in this school have the opportunity
before graduating of serving an apprenticeship as
teachers in the public schools of Worcester.</p>

<p>The “apprentice” acts as assistant to the teacher
of the city school; takes part in the instruction,
management and general care of the pupils under
the direction of the teacher; and is sometimes
entrusted with the sole charge of the school during
the teacher’s absence for an hour, a half day or a
day. One student only at a time is assigned to
any teacher, but each apprentice serves in at least
three grades of schools.</p>

<p>The time taken for the apprenticeship comes just
before the final term in the Normal School, and
amounts to half a school year. But the apprentices
spend one day of each week (Wednesday) at the
Normal School, where they are occupied in the
following manner:</p>

<p>They consult with the teacher, and with one
another, and make use of books.</p>

<p>They make informal statements to the school of
such facts of their experience as it may profit the
other pupils to know,—concerning ways of teaching,
cases of discipline and the like,—keeping in mind
always the private character of the daily life of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
school-room, and under special warning against
revelations that might seem objectionable.</p>

<p>Each apprentice keeps a diary of the occupation
and experience of every day, and this record is
inspected by the Faculty of the Normal School.</p>

<p>The Faculty of the Normal School have the right
of visiting the apprentices while at work, and of
giving advice and suggestion. When the six
months are over, the teacher of the school makes
a report on the work of the student. The School
Board approves the system, as those students who
have been apprentices are found afterwards to be
the most capable teachers in the Worcester public
schools. Students are not forced to undergo apprenticeship,
but most choose to do so. After it is over,
they return to the Normal School for six months,
before graduating.</p>

<p>Forty minutes each day are assigned to “Platform
Exercises,” which consist in reading, speaking, drawing
on the blackboard, etc., before the assembled
school. They are found to be very useful in helping
the students to overcome nervousness. Each
student can choose her own time and subject, but
at least nine must be ready to take part each day.
No exercise is to be prepared for more than four
minutes, but as questions may be asked by the
teachers or other students, and criticism is sometimes
offered, they often take longer.</p>

<p>A new and interesting feature of the school is
the children’s class which has just been started.
Between twenty and thirty children between three
and five have been admitted. No charge is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
for tuition, and it is understood that the class can
be taught in any way thought good by the Principal.
This class affords a good field for child-study
and experiment in methods of elementary teaching.
It is in charge of an experienced kindergartner.</p>

<p>I was attentively listening to a lecture on Psychology,
given by Principal Russell, when suddenly,
to my amazement, the whole class rose and left the
room while he was still speaking. To my surprise,
he did not seem at all disturbed, and he then proceeded
to explain, that finding that most students
were deficient in “time sense,” such a necessary
possession for a teacher, he had adopted the plan of
making the students keep their own time at lectures.</p>

<p>The Normal Art School, Boston, aims at training
art teachers and supervisors for the State. Two
courses are offered—one of four years’ training in
the scientific and artistic branches and their practical
application to industry, and one of two years’
training for the work of teaching or supervising Art
in the public schools.</p>

<p>The following is a comprehensive plan of the
work of this second course:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>First Year</i>:</p>

<p>1. Elements of psychology.</p>

<p>2. Outline course of drawing for Primary and Grammar
Schools.</p>

<p>3. Practice teaching.</p>

<p><i>Second Year</i>:</p>

<p>1. History of education.</p>

<p>2. Principles and methods of teaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>3. Outline course of drawing for High and Evening Schools.</p>

<p>4. Practice teaching.</p>

<p>5. Practical details of supervisor’s work.</p>

<p>6. Presentation of the subject of drawing by each pupil
before a body of assumed teachers.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>MICHIGAN.</i></h3>

<p>The State of Michigan maintains only one Normal
School, but, as we shall see later, this State has
other means of providing for the training of its
teachers.</p>

<p>This school is located at Ypsilante, and is not residential.
It is open to men and women, and tuition
is free to those who undertake to teach in the State
Schools. Graduates from recognised High Schools,
approved by the Board of Education upon recommendation
of the Faculty, are admitted without
examination, and are credited with advanced work
already done. Other candidates must pass an
entrance examination.</p>

<p>The school offers three classes of courses:</p>

<p>1. Those covering three years of instruction
leading to a certificate, which is a license to teach
in the schools of Michigan for a period of five years;
of these there are two, one especially for kindergartners,
and the other to prepare teachers for the
rural schools and for the lower High School grades.</p>

<p>2. Courses covering four years, leading to a
diploma and a life-certificate. Of these there are
many to choose from, but all are more or less distinctly
literary, scientific or classical.</p>

<p>3. Advanced courses, leading to the degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Bachelor of Pedagogics and a life-certificate. One
for graduates of any of the four year courses, and
can be completed in two years.</p>

<p>Any one holding an academic degree from the
University of Michigan, or from an incorporated
college, may receive the degree of B.Pd. by spending
one half-year at the school, and attending professional
instruction for 250 hours, and teaching under
supervision for 100 hours.</p>

<p>Any person holding the degree of Bachelor of
Pedagogics of the Michigan State Normal School
may, upon application, receive the degree of Master
of Pedagogics upon the following conditions:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) He shall furnish evidence satisfactory to the
Faculty that he has been engaged in teaching or in
school supervision continuously, and with pronounced
success, for five years since receiving the Bachelor’s
degree.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) He shall prepare and present a thesis acceptable
to the said Faculty, upon some subject connected
with the history, science, or art of education,
the Faculty reserving the right to assign the
subject of such thesis.</p>

<p>The design of the School is professional—<i>i.e.</i>, only
those students are admitted who intend to teach, but
a large portion of the various courses is devoted to
academic work. The school is directly under the
control of the State Board of Education, which
grants all certificates, diplomas and degrees upon
recommendation of the Faculty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<h3><i>ILLINOIS.</i></h3>

<p>This State, which, like that of Michigan, is typical
of the West, has provided two Normal Schools,
known under the somewhat imposing names of
the “Illinois State Normal University,” and the
“Southern Illinois State Normal University.”
Neither of these, however, are purely professional
schools. The first of them has three departments—Normal,
Training and High School, while the second
has also three—Normal, High School and Preparatory.</p>

<p>Tuition is free in the Normal Department of both
schools, to those who intend to teach in the State.</p>

<p>The courses in the Normal Departments are
usually for three years, but may be extended to four,
and at the completion of any course a diploma is
granted.</p>

<p>The work is very largely academic, and in the
first year hardly any really professional work is
done.</p>

<p>One of the Counties of Illinois—Cook—possesses
a Normal School which, although not technically a
State School, yet is so in reality, or indeed something
wider, for it attracts to itself students from all
parts of the States. This is known as the Cook
County School, or perhaps quite as often as Colonel
Parker’s School.</p>

<p>It is situated at Englewood, a suburb of Chicago,
and has a student’s hall attached to the school, where
students may obtain board and lodging.</p>

<p>As a school it is probably unique, and as such exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
difficult to estimate. When visiting it,
the charm of the School falls upon one, the enthusiasm
of Colonel Parker and his band of teachers
creates an atmosphere of inspiration which disarms
criticism, and few would come away without feeling
that the world was better than they thought, and a
little child the most beautiful thing to be found on
the earth. I think that it is in this genuine love
and care for children that the real strength of the
School lies, and that if it can continue to send out
teachers who really love and understand children, it
need fear no outside criticism. A chance remark of
Colonel Parker’s seemed to me typical of the spirit
of the School: “I do not want any of the children
to know that I am not one of them.”</p>

<p>The following extracts from his report to the Cook
County Board explain the distinguishing features of
the School:</p>

<p>1. Any graduate (four years’ course) of an
accredited High School, or a graduate of a college
or university, will be admitted to the Professional
Training Class, on presentation of diploma.</p>

<p>2. A teacher of three years’ successful experience
in a Graded School, and holding a first-class
certificate, will be admitted on presentation of said
certificate, and certificates of success as a teacher.</p>

<p>Candidates with the above credentials will be
admitted to the Professional Training Class at any
time.</p>

<p>1. Students must be members of the Professional
Training Class at least one year of forty
weeks before they are eligible for graduation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>2. Whenever, after one year, the members of
the Faculty are convinced that a student has the
necessary knowledge, skill and governing power to
teach and manage a school satisfactorily, the said
candidate is recommended for graduation to the
Board of Education.</p>

<p>The County Superintendent of Schools grants to
each graduate a certificate to teach in Cook County,
outside of Chicago, first or second grade, upon his
own examination and the recommendation of the
Principal.</p>

<p>First-grade certificates are given to those graduates
who have manifested during their course marked
ability in study and teaching.</p>

<p>Elective courses are allowed to those students only
who have received diplomas of graduation.</p>

<p>Graduates of the Professional Training Class may
elect for a one or two years’ course any one of the
following post-graduate courses:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. Kindergarten Training Class, physical training, elocution.</p>

<p>2. History, geography and literature.</p>

<p>3. Science, art and manual training.</p>

<p>4. Mathematics and manual training.</p>

<p>5. Modelling, painting, drawing and manual training.</p>

<p>6. Physical training, elocution, the Delsarte system of
expression, music, anatomy, physiology and hygiene.</p>

<p>7. Advanced course in psychology, pedagogics and
methods.</p>
</div>

<p>In all elective courses psychology, pedagogics and
methods are included.</p>

<p>The Practice School consists of eight grades (nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
rooms) and the kindergarten. There are two first
primary rooms (A and B).</p>

<p>Each room in the Practice School is under the
immediate charge of a critic teacher, who teaches
the pupils in her room, and supervises the practice
teaching in her grade.</p>

<p>The Practice School, with the exception of the
kindergarten, is a public school of the city of
Chicago.</p>

<p>The Practice School is an essential feature in the
training of teachers. The entire professional work
of the school is concentrated upon the teaching and
training in this department.</p>

<p>One hour each day is devoted to teaching in the
Practice School by members of the Professional
Training Class.</p>

<p>The Practice School is divided, for the purpose
of practice teaching, into forty or more groups, each
group consisting of from six to ten pupils. Two
groups are united, forming one section; two sections
are united to form a division.</p>

<p>Pupil teachers are very carefully selected for merit,
as (1) heads of groups; (2) leaders of sections; (3)
teachers of divisions; (4) special assistants. Pupil
teachers not thus chosen are assistants to group
leaders.</p>

<p>The purpose of these divisions into groups, etc.,
is to give each pupil-teacher as much practice as
possible. The teacher begins with a small number
of pupils, and advances, as teaching power increases,
to the leadership of a section, a division, and at last
to a special assistant’s position. The latter position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
requires the ability to teach and govern an entire
grade or room.</p>

<p>The entire work of the Professional Training Class
is, in reality, preparation for practice teaching,—preparation
in knowledge, theory and methods.</p>

<p>The course of work for the Training Class includes
the following subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. Psychology, pedagogics, the history of education and
methods of teaching.</p>

<p>2. Science in primary and grammar schools.</p>

<p>3. Geography with modelling, painting, drawing and
chalk modelling as means of geographical study.</p>

<p>4. History and literature.</p>

<p>5. Mathematics; number, arithmetic, form and geometry.</p>

<p>6. Art, including modelling, painting and drawing.</p>

<p>7. Physical training, elocution, the Delsarte system of expression
and vocal music.</p>

<p>8. Manual training, paste-board and wood sloyd and construction
of apparatus for science teaching.</p>
</div>

<p>The special teacher at the head of each department
presents the conditions for the knowledge
needed for teaching his or her subject, and decides
whether the pupil-teacher has the requisite knowledge
and skill to prepare a plan for teaching.</p>

<p>The special teacher also teaches the principles and
methods of his subject, and supervises the practice-work
in his department throughout all the grades.</p>

<p>The practice teaching is divided into ten periods
for one year, one period continuing for one month.</p>

<p>Each pupil-teacher is required to prepare one plan
for teaching, each month, upon a subject selected by
the critic teacher, under whose direct supervision the
pupil-teacher is to work. This plan must be approved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
by the critic teacher, and also by the special teacher
in charge of the subject taught, before the one who
prepares the plan is permitted to teach.</p>

<p>Each month, certain group, section and division
leaders are transferred from grade to grade in order
that every pupil who has requisite ability and skill
may teach in the eight grades during the course.</p>

<p>Whenever a pupil-teacher has reached the rank
of special assistant, he or she is sent out to the
county schools to act as substitute<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> upon the order
of the County Superintendent.</p>

<p>The course of study followed in the school is the
application of a doctrine or theory of education,
called the Theory of Concentration. Upon this
theory it was my privilege to hear Colonel Parker
lecture from time to time, and the following is a short
synopsis of his lectures as drawn up by himself.</p>

<p>“In this theory, the subjects of thought and study
are the natural sciences, geography and history.
The unity of these subjects is found in the study of
life—the laws of life—and the laws which support
life.</p>

<p>“The laws of life enter into the child through education,
and become the essentials in his intellectual
and moral character.</p>

<p>“Form, geometry, number and arithmetic are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
indispensable means for the study and investigation
of the laws of the universe acting through matter;
therefore form and number must be studied in order
to understand any and all subjects of thought.</p>

<p>“Attention is the one mode of study. Attention
may be divided into three modes of thinking: (1)
observation, (2) hearing language, (3) reading or
book study. The subjects or objects of attention are
the natural sciences, geography and history—therefore
observation, hearing language, and reading are
the means of knowing and thinking. The subjects
of knowing and thinking should be immediately
educative. Therefore, all acts of attention, observation,
hearing language and reading should be
concentrated upon these subjects, and objects of intrinsic
thought. For example: all reading should
be the most educative thinking, and therefore should
consist of the purest and most thoughtful literature.
Every word and sentence learned by the pupil should
be learned under the immediate impulse of intrinsic
thought.</p>

<p>“Under the theory of concentration, the modes of
expression—gesture, music, modelling, painting,
drawing, speech and writing, are used as the direct
and immediate means of intensifying intrinsic
thought, and under these impulses and stimuli the
technical forms of expression in each mode are adequately
acquired.</p>

<p>“The central and sole design of concentration is the
harmonious development of individual character—knowledge,
skill, are means, not ends—the eternal is
the end. It goes without saying that the application<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of this doctrine of concentration requires the
highest grade of knowledge, skill, art and devotion
to human development.</p>

<p>“Considering this course of study from the standpoint
of ‘knowledge for the sake of knowledge,’
taking the subjects presented in the light of ‘going
over,’ ‘going through,’ ‘being marked upon,’
‘final tests by written examinations,’ there must
be a hopeless confusion; the burden would be greater
than any corps of teachers could possibly bear.</p>

<p>“A course of study is a means to an end, and that
end the full development of all the possibilities for
good and growth in a human being. It should consist
of all the subjects of thought, the germs of which
a child spontaneously assimilates and enjoys before
he enters school. A course of study should be very
carefully arranged and adapted to the successive
stages or steps of development.</p>

<p>“Its application, however, depends wholly upon the
knowledge and skill of the teacher, the teacher who
watches closely and sympathetically every movement
of her pupil’s mind; the teacher who looks
upon a course of study as a rich storehouse of mental
food, to be presented as the mind needs it, or rejected
when the conditions are not favourable to growth.</p>

<p>“Following or ‘going over’ a course of study belongs
to the trade of school keeping, and not to the
art of teaching.</p>

<p>“This course of study cannot be understood by
studying the work of one grade alone—it must be
studied as a whole and applied with the comprehensive
knowledge of the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“The final decision as to what should be applied
to each individual pupil must be left to the teacher
of that pupil.</p>

<p>“No authority outside of the teacher of a pupil
can possibly determine what that pupil needs at
any given moment.</p>

<p>“Grading and promotion, properly understood,
are economical means of knowing and helping each
individual pupil.</p>

<p>“The course of study in its best form and last
analysis is the best means of helping each child, and
of helping each child to be of immediate and essential
aid to all his mates.”</p>

<h3><i>CITY NORMAL SCHOOLS.</i></h3>

<p>Very similar to the State Normal Schools in organization
and curriculum are those maintained by
certain cities. Of these the Philadelphia, New
York and Boston schools may be taken as representatives.
Such schools belong to the City School
systems, and are under the supervision of the City
Superintendent. Graduates from these schools are
supposed to teach in the public schools of the city.</p>

<p>At Philadelphia the Normal School is in a transition
state. Hitherto the Girls’ Normal School has
at the same time been the Girls’ High School, and
it was only possible to make a distinction in length
of course between those who were going to teach and
those who were not—the fourth year being especially
devoted to professional work. The tendency in such a
school would be, of course, to emphasize the academic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
work at the expense of the professional. According
to the new scheme, the High School and Normal
School will be separated, and the latter be purely
professional. Admission to the Normal School will
only be granted after a three years’ course at the
High School, and the former will have a course of
its own for two years. The present course of study
and the future scheme are subjoined.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Subjects to be studied in the two years’ course at
the new Girls’ Normal School, Philadelphia:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>&#160;&#160;1. Educational Psychology.<br>
&#160;&#160;2. Methods of Teaching.<br>
&#160;&#160;3. School Economy.<br>
&#160;&#160;4. The History of Education.<br>
&#160;&#160;5. The Philosophy of Education.<br>
&#160;&#160;6. Methods in Mathematics.<br>
&#160;&#160;7. Methods in Language and Literature.<br>
&#160;&#160;8. Methods in History, Sociology, and Civics.<br>
&#160;&#160;9. Methods in Natural History.<br>
10. Methods in Physics and Chemistry.<br>
11. Methods in Elocution.<br>
12. Methods in Vocal Music.<br>
13. Methods in Modelling and Drawing.<br>
14. Methods in Kindergarten.<br>
15. Methods in Gymnastics and Physical Training.<br>
16. Methods in Sewing and Fitting.<br>
17. Methods in Wood-work, etc.<br>
18. Observation in Model School.<br>
19. Practice in Model School.<br>
20. Discussion of Observation and Practice.<br>
21. Educational Reading and Original Investigation.</p>
</div>

<p>Mention must also be made of the provision made
for the training of men teachers in the new School
of Pedagogy which has been opened in connection
with the Central High School for boys. The
students must be graduates of the latter, or of
similar institutions. The course is for one year, and
includes professional subjects only.</p>

<p>The New York Normal College is conducted in
the same way as the present one at Philadelphia,
it being at once a High and Normal School.</p>

<h3><i>CITY TRAINING SCHOOLS.</i></h3>

<p>In several cities an ordinary school is set apart for
the special training of teachers, and is presided over
by a head-mistress capable of giving instruction in
the theory of education. In such a school the
ordinary teaching of the children is largely carried
on by the students, who at certain hours receive
instruction in Methods, etc. These students often
receive a small sum in return for their services.</p>

<p>I was able to visit several of these Training
Schools, including those at New Haven (Connecticut),
Fall River (Rhode Island), Pawtucket (Rhode
Island), Springfield (Massachusetts), and Albany
(New York).</p>

<p>At New Haven a most interesting Training School
is carried on in connection with the Welch School.
There are about thirty students in training for one
year. The various classes of the school are in
charge of regular teachers, who teach almost entirely
during the first half of the year, for the students
devote five or six months to the study of theory
alone, only giving a few criticism lessons during
that time. For the second half of the year the
students teach more in the schools, and are supervised
both by the critic teacher and the regular
teacher of the class. Notes of lessons are prepared
in various ways—sometimes the students are required
simply to put the matter of their lessons into
a series of logical statements, sometimes the matter
and illustrations alone are given, and sometimes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
lesson is written out as it is to be given in the order
of statements and questions.</p>

<p>On the completion of the year’s training the
students are usually appointed as substitute teachers
to the districts, at a small fixed salary, and obtain
permanent posts as vacancies occur.</p>

<p>At the Springfield Training School from ten to
sixteen students take the course, which is usually
for one year, but can be taken in two. Tuition is
free to those living in the city, a charge of about
£10 being made to those from a distance.</p>

<p>Students enter in the autumn, and devote the
first term to theoretical work, only giving a few
criticism lessons, and spending some time in observing
the work of the school, and carefully recording
observations.</p>

<p>The work in psychology is partly based on the
observation of individual children, and partly carried
on by discussion classes. The students also attend
lectures given by Superintendent Balliet to all the
teachers of the city. At the end of the year they
take the city examination in order to graduate. In
January they begin to teach for an hour a day in
the school, and in the summer term this is increased
to three hours a day. At the end of the course
they give lessons in public, but they are not counted
as necessary for graduation.</p>

<p>Some of the leading features of the Training
School are the following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>1. It is incorporated with a city or town Graded
School covering from four to eight years’ work.
This school is used as a place for observation and
practice.</p>

<p>2. The Practice School, or school of observation,
employs one or more regular teachers, who conduct
the training class. In most Training Schools,
“trainers” are relied upon for much of the teaching.</p>

<p>3. The course in the Training School includes a
study of the principles of teaching and the history
of education, with practice in the art.</p>

<p>4. The length of the term of study and practice is
fixed, extending from one to two years in the greater
number of schools.</p>

<p>5. A new class is admitted at a fixed time; the
admissions are annual or semi-annual.</p>

<p>6. The maximum number of trainers is prescribed.</p>

<p>7. Admissions are made by a course of studies
previously pursued, or by examination. Most require
the equivalent of a four years’ course in a High
School.</p>

<p>8. All provide for dropping unpromising students
from the roll.</p>

<p>9. Most allow some compensation to trainers after
the first term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>A list of Training Schools in Massachusetts is
appended. It is taken from a useful little pamphlet
drawn up for the information of visitors to the
World’s Fair Educational Exhibit.</p>

<h3><i>PEDAGOGICAL DEPARTMENTS IN UNIVERSITIES.</i></h3>

<p>It has been seen that a certain number of college
graduates enter the Normal Schools for a course of
training, but most of the leading Universities of
America are now providing courses in the Science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and Art of Education for those who desire to prepare
for the teaching profession. I was able to visit a
good many of these pedagogical departments, and
was much interested in the work I saw. This work,
however, differs so widely in the various institutions
in which it is carried on that it is hardly possible to
make any very general statements concerning it.
In some universities the only provision made for the
special preparation of teachers is in connection with
special classes held by the professor or lecturer on
any subject, for those who wish to discuss with him
the teaching of it. However insufficient for training
purposes this plan may be, it yet has, I believe, very
special advantages to recommend it, not the least
being the influence that may be thus exerted by the
University through those who are about to become
teachers on the Schools. In addition to these discussions,
some provide for a few lectures on Pedagogy,
and in others, again, Pedagogy may be taken
as an elective subject, and count towards an ordinary
degree. The Universities of Harvard, Cornell,
Michigan, Illinois, Syracuse and others have adopted
one or other of these plans.</p>

<p>The University of New York grants degrees in
pedagogy, while at the Clark University, to which
only graduates are admitted, education may be taken
as part of the Ph.D. work. It should be noted,
however, that the courses of training provided at
these Universities is almost entirely theoretical,
little or no attempt being made to arrange for practical
work. In so far as this is not arranged for, the
training seems to fall short of the ideal, it being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
surely nearly as bad to attempt to train teachers
without providing for practical work as to teach
chemistry without giving any time to the laboratory,
or to train a doctor without arranging for hospital
work. Probably the fact that a course on pedagogics
is usually taken at the same time as other
subjects, and also that those who take such courses
very often do not intend to teach in the schools, but
rather to take posts as lecturers, superintendents,
etc., has caused this side of training to be neglected,
and a still stronger reason is to be found in the
location of so many of the Universities at a distance
from the schools. In many places, however, I found
that the question was being faced, and schemes considered
for the introducing of practical work.</p>

<p>Harvard has begun to realize its responsibility
with respect to the training of teachers, and a subdivision
of the department of Philosophy is devoted
to Education, the following courses being arranged
for:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. Course of twelve lectures on Topics in Psychology
of interest to teachers.</p>

<p>2. Course for Graduates and Undergraduates:</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>The History of Educational Theories and
Practices.</p>
</div>

<p>3. Course primarily for graduates:</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Organization of Public Schools and Academies.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Theory of Teaching.</p>
</div></div>

<p>These courses are, however, but short, and intended
to be taken at the same time as other subjects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
There is as yet no attempt to arrange for
a complete course of training, but every prospect
that from the beginning already made there may
develop a graduate school for the training of teachers.</p>

<p>Harvard has already realized its responsibility in
respect to the inspection and supervision of schools,
for which I was given to understand very special
arrangements are being made, and it will be but a
step further for it to provide such training for the
teachers it sends out to these schools as shall fit
them duly for their work.</p>

<p>There are certain elective courses allowed in the
philosophy course, at the University of Cornell,
which really constitute a pedagogical department.
They include the following:</p>

<p>1. Institutes of Education (Lectures).</p>

<p>2. School Systems and Organizations (Lectures).</p>

<p>3. Pedagogic Conference, Discussions and Essays
on Educational topics, and reports on visits to
schools.</p>

<p>4. History of Education (Lectures).</p>

<p>5. Pedagogical Seminary.</p>

<p>It is understood that none must take these courses
unless they also know something of physiology,
psychology and logic. These courses may either be
attended so as to count towards a degree or may be
taken as graduate work.</p>

<p>The only arrangement for practical work is in
connection with the visits to schools for purposes of
observation. The location of the University on the
top of a hill overlooking Ithaca, although most
advantageous in many other respects, would make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the arranging for work in the schools or the establishment
of a University School of Observation a
matter of serious difficulty.</p>

<p>Seminaries are held in most subjects, at which the
teaching methods are discussed, and thus opportunity
is afforded to those students who are specializing
in any subject with the intention of afterwards
teaching it, to study it from the point of view of
the teacher as well as of the learner.</p>

<p>To Michigan belongs the honour of having been
the first University to undertake to provide professional
training for teachers. Professor W. H. Payne
was made the first professor of the Science and Art
of Teaching in 1879, and on his leaving the University
Professor Hinsdale carried on the work.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
following extract from the Calendar of the Michigan
University explains the views held by its faculty as
to the importance of the training of teachers:</p>

<p>“The aims of the University in providing instruction
in the Science and the Art of Teaching are:</p>

<p>“1. To fit University students for the higher positions
in the public school service.</p>

<p>“It is a natural function of the University, as the
head of our system of public instruction, to supply
the demand made upon it for furnishing the larger
public schools with superintendents, principals, and
assistants. Year by year these important positions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
are falling more and more into the hands of men
that have received their education in the University.
Till recently the training given to our graduates
has been almost purely literary; it has lacked the
professional character that alone gives special fitness
for the successful management of schools and school
systems. Now, however, the University offers
students that wish to become teachers ample facilities
for professional study.</p>

<p>“2. To promote the study of educational science.</p>

<p>“The establishment of a chair of teaching is a
recognition of the truth that the art of education
has its correlative science; and that the processes of
the school-room can become rational only by developing
and teaching the principles that underlie
these processes. Systems of public instruction are
everywhere on trial, and the final criteria by which
they are to stand or fall must be found in a philosophical
study of the educating art.</p>

<p>“3. To teach the history of education, and of
educational systems and doctrines.</p>

<p>“The supreme right of the school is to grow; and
much hurtful interference might be avoided by
ascertaining the direction of educational progress
and the history of educational thought.</p>

<p>“4. To secure to teaching the rights, prerogatives,
and advantages of a profession.</p>

<p>“5. To give a more perfect unity to our State educational
system by bringing the secondary schools
into closer relations with the University.”</p>

<p>The Teacher’s diploma is given to a student at
the time of receiving a Bachelor’s degree, provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
he has completed three Courses of study offered by
the professor of the Science and Art of Teaching,
viz., Courses 1 and 2, and one of Courses 3, 5, 4, 6,
or 7, and, also, at least one of the Teachers’ Courses
offered by other professors, and by special examination
has shown such marked proficiency in the Course
chosen as qualifies him to give instruction in the
same. The diploma is also given to a graduate
student at the time of receiving a Master’s or a
Doctor’s degree, provided he has pursued teaching
as a major or a minor study, and has also taken a
Teacher’s Course in some other department.</p>

<p>By authority of an Act of the State legislature,
passed in 1891, the Faculty of this Department give
a Teacher’s Certificate to any person who takes a
Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Doctor’s degree, and also
receives a Teacher’s diploma as provided above.
By the terms of the Act, the certificate given by the
Faculty “shall serve as a legal certificate of qualification
to teach in any of the schools of this State,
when a copy thereof shall have been filed or recorded
in the office of the legal examining officer or officers
of the county township, city, or district.”</p>

<p>To meet these special requirements the following
courses have been arranged:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>First Course</i>:</p>

<p>1. Practical: the arts of teaching and governing; methods
of instruction and general school-room practice; school
hygiene: school law. Recitations and lectures.</p>

<p>3. History of education: ancient and mediæval. Recitations
and lectures. Text-book: Compayré’s History of
Pedagogy.</p>

<p>5. School supervision; embracing general school management,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the art of grading and arranging courses of study, the
conduct of institutes, etc. Recitations and lectures. Text-book;
Payne’s chapters on School Supervision.</p>

<p><i>Second Course</i>:</p>

<p>2. Theoretical and critical; the principles underlying the
arts of teaching and governing. Lectures.</p>

<p>4. History of education; modern. Recitations and lectures.
Text-book; Compayré’s History of Pedagogy.</p>

<p>6. The comparative study of educational systems, domestic
and foreign. Lectures.</p>

<p>7. Seminary. Study and discussion of special topics in the
History and Philosophy of Education.</p>

<p>Special Teachers’ Courses are also arranged for in most
subjects, and attendance at one at least of these is necessary
in order to obtain the Teacher’s diploma.</p>
</div>

<p>The University of Illinois has a course in Pedagogy
which may count towards a degree. It may count
towards most of the degrees granted, but for the degree
in philosophy and pedagogy, and which implies
a four years’ course, the arrangement is as follows:—</p>

<p>The first and second years of this course may be
those of any course in the College of Literature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h4><span class="smcap">Third Year.</span></h4>

<p>1. Psychology; Chemistry or History; Latin, German or
French.</p>

<p>2. Logic; Zoology, or History, Latin, German, or French.</p>

<p>3. Philosophy of Education; Geology, or History; Latin,
German or French.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fourth Year.</span></h4>

<p>1. History of Education; Educational Psychology; History
of Civilization; English (half course); Elocution.</p>

<p>2. School hygiene; Constitutional History (England);
English, (half course); Elocution.</p>

<p>3. School Supervision; Pedagogical Seminary; Political
Economy, or Constitutional History (U.S.); English, (half

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>The University of Indiana possesses a department
of pedagogics the courses of which count towards
a degree. There are three courses.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) Educational Psychology (a knowledge of Psychology being presupposed).<br>
(<i>b</i>) The School as an Institution.<br>
(<i>c</i>) The General History of Education.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) The Science of Education.<br>
(<i>b</i>) Didactics.<br>
(<i>c</i>) City School Systems.<br>
(<i>d</i>) School Supervision.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) Contemporary Education.<br>
(<i>b</i>) School System of Indiana.<br>
(<i>c</i>) Philosophy of Education.</p>
</div>

<p>Special Teachers’ Courses in certain subjects are
also given.</p>

<p>The School of Pedagogy in connection with the
University of the City of New York, is based upon
the idea that a degree should follow successful
teaching. It has three professors and a lecturer.
Only those are admitted as regular students who
are graduates of Colleges, or of the New York State
Normal Schools, but others may, at the discretion of
the Faculty, be admitted as auditors. It was established
in 1890 and has had 134 students.</p>

<p>The courses of study are as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>
1. History of Education.<br>
2. Psychology and Ethics.<br>
3. Institutes of Education.<br>
4. Educational Classics and Æsthetics.<br>
5. Systems of Education.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>For the degree of Doctor of Pedagogy a thesis to
be known as the “Thesis for the Doctorate in Pedagogy”
has to be submitted for approval to the
Faculty. This thesis must discuss a subject belonging
to the field of one of the courses of study, and
must show original treatment, or give evidence of
independent research.</p>

<p>Each student who has been a member of the
Senior Class for two or more years will be entitled
to the degree of Doctor of Pedagogy upon the following
conditions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. He must have been credited with attendance
upon the required lectures.</p>

<p>2. He must have been credited with attendance
upon the required seminaria.</p>

<p>3. He must have passed an examination upon each
of the five courses.</p>

<p>4. He must have presented the prescribed final
thesis, and have received approval of the same.</p>

<p>5. He must have presented upon entering the
School of Pedagogy a certain certificate showing four
years’ successful experience in school-room work.</p>
</div>

<p>Each student of the School who has been a member
of the Junior Class for one or more years, and a
resident student at least one year, will be entitled to
the degree of Master of Pedagogy upon the following
conditions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. He must have been credited with attendance
upon the required lectures.</p>

<p>2. He must have passed the examination upon
each of the four courses first named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>3. He must present a certificate showing three
years’ successful experience in school-room work.</p>
</div>

<p>The Iowa University was the first to allow pedagogics
to count towards a degree. Graduates of the
University who have included in their course the
year’s course of pedagogy may, after two years of
successful teaching, be granted the degree of
Bachelor of Didactics.</p>

<p>There is at New York an Institution which
appeared to me to be unique in America, but of
which the work more nearly resembled the best
Secondary Training as carried on in Great Britain
than any other which I had the opportunity of studying.
It is known as the New York College for the
Training of Teachers. It received its charter from
the Board of Regents of the University of the State
of New York in 1889, constituting it a Training
College with the power of granting professional degrees.
This year, however, it enters on a new phase
of its life, having been affiliated with the Columbia
College at New York.</p>

<p>Columbia College had already made provision for
lectures on the Science and Art of Education, but
its connection with the Teachers’ College, will enable
it to offer in addition the advantages of training in
the practical art of teaching to its students. On
the other hand, it is felt to be an advantage to the
Teachers’ College to be allied with a College of
University rank—Columbia College—which will
thus show by example that it is possible to combine
both theoretical and practical training in a University
Course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>The full course of study leading to the degree
of Bachelor of Pedagogy occupies two years. All
candidates for admission must pass an entrance examination
unless they are graduates from Colleges
or other specified Institutions.</p>

<p>The ordinary course of study includes the following
subjects:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. Psychology (pure and applied).</p>

<p>2. History and Principles of Education.</p>

<p>3. Methods of Teaching.</p>

<p>4. Observation and Practice in the School of Observation
and Practice.</p>

<p>5. School Organization and Administration in the United
States, England, France and Germany.</p>

<p>6. Theory and Practice of the Kindergarten.</p>

<p>7. Teaching of Natural Science and construction of simple
illustrative Apparatus.</p>

<p>8. Manual Training (this includes Form Study, Drawing,
Domestic Economy, Mechanical Drawing and Wood Working).</p>
</div>

<p>All are recommended to take the general Course
by special opportunities offered to those who wish to
become specialists.</p>

<p>Any teacher of high scholarship and experience
may come to the College for one year and take up
an advanced elective course.</p>

<p>I. The degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy and the
College diploma, respectively, are conferred, upon
recommendation of the Faculty, upon such students,
being duly qualified candidates for the same, as have
completed a course of study covering two years, as
follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><i>Required work in the following Departments</i>:</p>

<p>
Department of History and Institutes of Education.<br>
Department of Science and Art of Teaching.<br>
Department of Kindergarten, Course I.<br>
Department of Form Study and Drawing, Course I.<br>
Department of Physical Training.</p>

<p><i>Elective</i>:</p>

<p>A major course or minor courses.</p>
</div>

<p>II. The College Certificate is conferred, upon recommendation
of the President, the Dean, and the
Professor in charge of any department, upon such
qualified candidates as have completed a course of
study covering one year, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p>
Department of History and Institutes of Education.<br>
Department of Science and Art of Teaching.<br>
Department of Physical Culture.</p>

<p><i>Elective</i>:</p>

<p>In any department, a major course, together with such
other minor courses as will suffice to make up the required
amount of work.</p>
</div>

<p>III. The Departmental Certificate, Major or Minor,
is conferred, upon recommendation of the professors
in charge of the departments in which studies
leading to this certificate are pursued, upon such
qualified candidates as have completed a course of
study as follows:—</p>

<p>Department of History and Institutes of Education,
Course I.</p>

<p>In any department or departments, either Major
or Minor courses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>There is also a two years’ course for the training
of Kindergartners, on the completion of which a
certificate is granted, and a post-graduate course for
those who desire it.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-six students were in
training when I visited it, and of these only three
or four were men.</p>

<p>The whole course of training centres round the
School of Observation and Practice. The lecturers on
method also teach in the school, and are responsible
there for the teaching of their own special subjects.
They give lessons on these, which are listened to
by the students, and they also criticise lessons given
by the latter. A good deal of the time devoted to
the study of methods is employed in the learning
how to make simple apparatus and illustrations.</p>

<p>Classes are held on Saturdays for those who are
engaged in teaching during the rest of the week.</p>

<p>The college has also undertaken the publication
of a series of pamphlets on educational subjects.</p>

<p>The whole work of this college impressed me as
being of a very high character, and there was such
an atmosphere of life and enthusiasm that it would
seem that teachers must go forth from thence inspired
with a love for their work and a determination
to advance it by every means in their power. It is
just this rousing to enthusiasm which seems to lie
at the root of training, and the surest means of
bringing this about is for those who undertake it to
be enthusiastic themselves. I had the opportunity
of talking to most of the lecturers, and shall not
readily forget the keen interest and pleasure they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
all seemed to take in their special departments, the
readiness, nay eagerness, with which they appeared
to welcome new ideas and work them out, and the
willingness with which they shared with others the
results of their own experience and research.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the many institutions
which I visited was the Clark University
at Worcester. It is entirely devoted to Graduate
work, and consists of a group of five departments: 1.
Mathematics; 2. Physics; 3. Chemistry; 4. Biology;
5. Psychology (with sub-department of Education).</p>

<p>Two or three years’ work at the University and
an original thesis are the requirements for the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy.</p>

<p>There is no very clearly marked line between professors
and students. Students are often specialists,
and as such asked to give short courses in their
special subjects, and professors and lecturers attend
each other’s courses.</p>

<p>Docents, or those who, having fulfilled certain
conditions, desire to undertake research work, are
provided with rooms and apparatus for their work.</p>

<p>The President, Dr. Stanley Hall, is especially
interested in the department of Education. The
following outline of the course is from the University
Calendar:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Education.</span>—This has been made a sub-department
of the department of Psychology, and now
offers a course which can be taken as a Minor for
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Its work is in
the closest connection with the work in psychology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and anthropology, and in part based on these. The
work in this department is intended to meet the
needs of the following classes of men:</p>

<p>“<i>First.</i>—Those intending to teach some other
speciality, but who wish a general survey of the
history, present state, methods, and recent advances
in the field of university, professional, and technical
education.</p>

<p>“<i>Second.</i>—Those who desire to become professors
of pedagogy, or heads or instructors in normal
schools, superintendents, or otherwise to become
experts in the work of education.”</p>
</div>

<p>The programme of the Educational Department
includes courses upon the following subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>I. (<i>a</i>) Child-Study. (<i>b</i>) Educational Psychology. (<i>c</i>)
School Hygiene.</p>

<p>II. (<i>a</i>) Principles of Education. (<i>b</i>) History of Education
and Reforms. (<i>c</i>) Methods, Devices, Apparatus, etc.</p>

<p>III. (<i>a</i>) Organization of Schools in different countries. (<i>b</i>)
Typical Schools and Special Foundations. (<i>c</i>) Motor Education,
including manual training, physical education, etc.
(<i>d</i>) Moral Education. (<i>e</i>) Ideals.</p>

<p>IV. Higher Education, including university work, technical
education; training in law, medicine, and theology;
recent progress, present state and prospects of the most
advanced education in different countries, including our own.</p>
</div>

<p>The courses in education for 1893-94 are as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Dr. G. Stanley Hall’s Courses</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot3">
<p>(<i>A</i>) Present status and problems of Higher Education in
this country and Europe. One hour weekly, half a year.</p>

<p>(<i>B</i>) Outline of Systematic Pedagogy. One hour weekly,
half a year.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span><i>Dr. Burnham’s Courses</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot3">
<p>(<i>C</i>) Organization of schools in Europe, especially the
schools of France, Germany, Sweden, and England. Typical
schools described, and educational principles illustrated by
them, expounded and discussed. References made to important
literature, and the work may serve as an outline for
further study. One hour a week, half a year.</p>

<p>(<i>D</i>) School Hygiene, following and supplementing his
“Outlines of School Hygiene,” and considering special topics.
One hour a week, half a year.</p>

<p>(<i>E</i>) Educational reforms, involving the discussion of a few
fundamental educational principles and the presentation of
chapters in the history of education. One hour a week, half
a year.</p>

<p>(<i>F</i>) Motor Education of children. This course will endeavour
to elucidate the principles that should govern this
side of education, and will involve the study of writing,
drawing, manual training, and of play and gymnastics as
means of motor education. The course may include also the
study of motor training and muscular development in relation
to intellectual ability and moral character. One hour a
week, half a year.</p>

<p>(<i>G</i>) The work of the Seminary, once a week throughout
the year, will be, for the most part, adapted to individual
students. It is hoped that each student will select, after
conference with President Hall and Dr. Burnham, a topic
for special investigation. The results of such study may be
published.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The courses as announced above may be modified
somewhat as the needs of the students or other
circumstances may require.</p>

<p>The library of the department is especially rich
in foreign educational literature, and a considerable
amount of illustrative apparatus has been collected.
The Worcester Public Library and the library of
the American Antiquarian Society are also accessible
to students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>The <i>Pedagogical Seminary</i> is published by this
department, and offers facilities for printing digests,
reviews, and more valuable papers prepared by the
members of the department.</p>

<p>This department has the twofold aim of (1) preparing
professors, superintendents and teachers for
their future work, and (2) making contributions to
the Science of Education. The second of these aims
is being vigorously taken up, research of some kind
being expected from every one. The fact that there
is no school of observation in connection with the
University is of course a drawback to the complete
carrying out of both of the above aims. Visits, for
purposes of observation, are however made to schools
in the neighbourhood, the records now numbering
some fifteen thousand made by the students of the
Worcester Normal School, in connection with the
study of children, are available for reference, and
a scheme for establishing a University School is
even now under consideration. Should this scheme
become a reality, we might look forward hopefully
to getting fresh light on many school problems.
One especially, to which Dr. Hall drew my attention,
might well have its solution attempted in such a
school. It concerns the duty of teachers toward
the bright, quick-working children in a school. In
every class some will be found who work quicker
and have more intellectual power than the others,
and at the same time some who are dull and slow-witted.
Now the power of detecting and directing
one’s teaching to the latter is often made the test
of a good teacher, and in a very true sense it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
be said to be so. But there is another side to the
question, and those of us who have taught cannot
fail to have often been conscious that while the
needed attention and explanations are being given
to the dull ones, the time of the quick-working
children is being practically wasted. As Dr. Hall
points out, we have perhaps not yet realized how
much power is lost to the world in consequence.
It would be an interesting experiment to select such
bright, quick-witted children, and putting them into
a class by themselves, in charge of an able teacher,
to note the results of thus allowing them to work at
their own rate.</p>

<p>The Clark University is unfortunately not open
to women, if the summer school (to which they are
admitted) be not considered.</p>

<p>Students are expected to possess a reading knowledge
of the French and German languages, and a
knowledge of Elementary Psychology is also considered
desirable.</p>

<p>There are many other Universities which have
opened more or less complete pedagogical departments;
but these which have been described will
suffice to give a general idea of the courses offered
in them. On the whole it appeared to me that
while in America excellent provision is made in
many of the States for the training of teachers for
the Primary Schools on the one hand, and for the
positions of professors, lecturers, superintendents on
the other, far too little attention is given to the
training of teachers for the High, Collegiate and
Private Schools. High School teachers are mainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
those who have worked their way up through the
grades (salaries tend to increase with the grade,
which brings about that inexperienced teachers are
too often put to the lower classes), while the teachers
in Collegiate and Private Schools have usually taken
up the work straight from college without any
special preparation at all. England and Wales have,
I think, made much better provision for the training
of such teachers, but I think we have a good deal
to learn from America in providing for the training
of lecturers, school inspectors, etc., etc., and perhaps
also in the matter of setting the seal of University
approval upon training, by the bestowal of educational
degrees.</p>

<h3><i>TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES.</i></h3>

<p>Teachers’ Institutes form an integral part of most
state and city systems of education. They have
been defined as “normal schools with a very short
course,” and this definition is substantially correct.
The work done by them is of much the same character
as that done in the Normal Schools, and they
have the same end in view—that of making teachers
more fit for their profession. They, however, vary
somewhat in character, and it will be perhaps well
to distinguish between—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Those which are held on Saturdays for teachers
in the city or district, and which are usually conducted
by the superintendent, who gives lectures on
the Science and Art of Teaching, discusses educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
problems and methods, or follows out with
them a course of reading. Attendance at these
institutes is often made compulsory, and loss of
part of salary is sometimes made the penalty for
non-attendance. By the statistics returned from
ninety-six cities holding institutes, it appears that
forty-four thus enforce attendance.</p>

<p>2. Those lasting for about six to ten days, having
short courses in certain subjects, and especially on
the theory of teaching. These are usually those
organized by the State Superintendent, who has
however the power of delegating the conduct of
these institutes to other persons whom he may deem
qualified. Again, attendance at many of these is
made compulsory.</p>

<p>3. Such institutes as are held at some country or
sea-side place for a length of time, varying from a
fortnight to six weeks. These, however, are mostly
started by private agencies, and have little besides
the name to distinguish them from Summer Schools.
The summer meeting of teachers at Martha’s Vineyard
is known as an Institute, and is of this class.
The Teachers’ Institutes do not aim at supplying
a complete course of Training, but rather at supplementing
the work of the Normal Schools and
Colleges.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>SUMMER SCHOOLS AND COURSES.</i></h3>

<p>A Summer School seems to differ from an Institute
mainly in relation to the amount of professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
work undertaken. It is usually open for from four
to six weeks, and has a great variety of courses. I
was able to attend several of these, and was kindly
allowed to hear some of the lectures given and to
observe the work.</p>

<p>One of these held at Benton Harbour, Michigan,
was chiefly attended by those district teachers who
wished to prepare for the teachers’ examinations.
It was really a private Normal School, which used
its buildings in July for a Summer School. The
subjects given were mainly those necessary for the
teachers’ certificates, with some classes on Methods,
and School Management and Drill and Elocution.</p>

<p>Of quite a different kind was that held at the
Cook County Normal School. This was almost
entirely professional, and held on much the same
lines as the ordinary work of the school.</p>

<p>The Summer Assembly at Chautauqua includes a
Summer School, which again may be said to include
a special course for teachers, called the Teachers’
Retreat.</p>

<p>In addition to the Summer Schools, there are
summer courses provided for teachers at many
universities. Cornell University makes special provision
for such a course, of which the following is
an announcement.</p>

<p>“In the summer of 1892, courses of instruction were
offered by professors and instructors of this University
in Botany, Chemistry, Mathematics, Philosophy,
Physics, English, French, German, Drawing, and
Physical Training. The Summer School has now
been made an integral part of the University, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
for the summer of 1893, courses are offered in the
following subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Greek,<br>
Latin,<br>
German,<br>
French,<br>
English,<br>
Elocution,<br>
Philosophy,<br>
Pedagogy,<br>
History,<br>
Political and Social Science,<br>
Mathematics,<br>
Physics,<br>
Chemistry,<br>
Botany,<br>
Drawing and Art,<br>
Mechanical Drawing,<br>
Physical Training.</p>
</div>

<p>Without excluding others qualified to take up
the work, these courses are offered for the special
benefit of teachers. They afford a practical scheme
of university extension, by which the teachers
themselves are taught under university instructors,
by university methods, and with access to university
libraries, museums, and laboratories.</p>

<p>The courses are open to women as well as to men,
and the same facilities for work are extended to
these students as to the regular students of the
university. The amount of work implied in these
courses is so great that students are advised to confine
their attention to one or two subjects. Every
opportunity will be given for original research under
the guidance and with the assistance of members of
the instructing corps.”</p>

<p>In 1892 a summer course in Psychology and
Pedagogy was held for two weeks at the Clark
University. All the resources of the University—books,
apparatus, etc.—were placed at the disposal
of the students. About seventy men and women
attended. Other universities arrange for similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
courses, but these two suffice to indicate the lines
of work.</p>

<p>The Prang system, which aims at the complete
organization of Form Study, Drawing and Colour
teaching in the schools, demands also the training
of its teachers. The system is being introduced
into an ever-increasing number of schools, and
necessitates some preparation on the part of the
teacher in order that its principles shall be rightly
understood and effectively carried out. This preparation
is being carried on by correspondence. The
courses of study are definitely arranged, and the
student chooses the one she desires. The text-books
and materials are sent to her; she works lessons at
home, and forwards to the instructors the results of
such work—clay modelling, paper-folding, drawing,
etc., written observation exercises describing the
appearance of models placed in prescribed positions,
written outlines for various class exercises, together
with any questions she desires to ask. This work
is examined and returned to the student with full
criticisms. At the end of the course a certificate is
awarded to those who have successfully completed
it. This plan of training appears to answer well,
and will ensure the success of the system.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
